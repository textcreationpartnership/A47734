            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Did not intend to have troubled you with any <hi>Preface:</hi> But this is occaſioned by a Pamphlet lately publiſhed, called, <hi>An Anſwer to</hi> GREAT BRITAIN's JUST COMPLAINT; wherein, <hi>pag.</hi> 54. there is this Character of the Book I have Anſwered, which he calls Dr. <hi>King</hi>'s, (whom I have not nam'd, but now may, from the Authority of this Author:) <hi>A Book</hi> (ſays he) <hi>writ with that known Truth, and Firmneſs of Reaſon, that every Page of it is a Demonſtration; which hath been often threatned with an Anſwer: but the long ſilence of the</hi> Party <hi>ſhews</hi> Guilt <hi>and</hi> Deſpair.</p>
            <p>For the long ſilence; I muſt tell the Reader, That this Anſwer was prepared upon the firſt coming out of Dr. <hi>King</hi>'s Book, (and therefore the Quotations of the Page are according to the firſt Edition of it in <hi>Quarto,</hi>) in the later Editions the Doctor has found cauſe to make ſome Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I have taken notice of.</p>
            <p>That this Anſwer has not before this time appeared in Print, has been occaſioned by the ſevere Watch that is kept over all the Preſſes, which has made many interruptions, and long delays; conſidering which, it is more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at that it has now got through the Briars, than that it has ſtuck ſo long.</p>
            <p>This muſt excuſe a Difference you will find in the Paper in ſome Sheets, and other Eye-ſores of the Impreſſion, being done at different Times and Places.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59238:3"/>For theſe I ſhall be leſs concern'd, if you will pardon one which was occaſioned by the Importunity and Fears of ſome of the Printers, that is, to call People by their uſual, though not <hi>proper</hi> Names, like the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>'s <hi>de Facto</hi> Husband, (<hi>Joh.</hi> iv. 16.) or as <hi>Oliver</hi> was called a <hi>Protector,</hi> and <hi>Abſalom</hi> a <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Anſwer to <hi>Britain</hi>'s <hi>Complaint,</hi> recites ſome of the groſſeſt Miſtakes of Dr. <hi>King</hi>'s Book, and, from his Credit, delivers them for moſt undoubted Truths: As, pag. 54. <hi>That the Repeal of the Acts of Settlement was carried on by King</hi> James<hi>'s own Sollicitation; and that he did ſtruggle with his Biſhops and Judges to carry it; and after he was duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Cruelty and Injuſtice of it, that he ſtill preſſed it, and at laſt got it paſſed.</hi> The notorious Falſhood of which, I have ſhewn from undeniable and good <hi>Protestant</hi> Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and more are to be had, if either of theſe Authors have the hardineſs not to ſubmit upon that Point.</p>
            <p>Pamphlet, pag. 55. <hi>Every where</hi> Proteſtant Churches <hi>were taken from them by Force, and given to</hi> Popiſh Prieſts, <hi>by the Order or Connivance of the late King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is ſo far from Truth, that Dr. <hi>King</hi> himſelf gives Inſtances to the contrary, and tells (<hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 18 <hi>n.</hi> 11.) how King <hi>James</hi> did ſtruggle againſt the Popiſh Clergy, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and turn'd out the Mayor of <hi>Wexford</hi> for not obeying His Majeſty's Orders in Reſtoring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants Church there, which the Popiſh Clergy had uſurp'd; and that <hi>He appear'd moſt zealous to have the Church Reſtored; and expreſt himſelf with more paſſion than was uſual</hi> upon that occaſion.</p>
            <p>And Dr. <hi>King</hi> cannot name one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that was taken from them either by King <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Connivance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſty was ſo very careful in this Point, that even at <hi>Dublin,</hi> where he kept his Court, neither the <hi>Cathedral,</hi> nor any Pariſh-Church in the whole City was taken from the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> The King only took <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> for his own uſe, which was always reputed as the King's Chappel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: And Dr. <hi>King</hi> himſelf and others then preached <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> in their own Pulpits in <hi>Dublin</hi> to that degree, as to
<pb facs="tcp:59238:3"/>give offence to ſome of their Proteſtant Hearers, who thought they ſtretched it even to Flattery.</p>
            <p>Pamphlet. <hi>This was done in thoſe parts of</hi> Ireland <hi>where the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>were very peaceable under King</hi> James.</p>
            <p>That is, where they were ſo under his Power, that they durſt not ſtir, for none elſe then in that Kingdom were quiet; and even thoſe who lived under King <hi>James</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection were giving Intelligence againſt him, and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all they could; which Dr. <hi>King</hi> does not only <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,</hi> but <hi>juſtifies</hi> it, and was himſelf one of the Chief; which I have ſufficiently ſhewn, and I ſuppoſe he will not deny, but reckons it now as his Merit.</p>
            <p>Pamphlet. <hi>Thoſe</hi> (Proteſtants) <hi>who ſcaid in</hi> Ireland, <hi>were oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But it is evident that they preſerved their Effects, Houſes and Improvements, better than thoſe who left the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and now live Richer, and have more to ſhew, which they preſerved by King <hi>James</hi>'s Clemency, than their Neighbours brought with them from the Countries whither they fled from his Protection.</p>
            <p>Pamphlet. <hi>Upon Complaint no Proteſtant could have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſhewn many who had. And I believe Dr. <hi>King</hi> cannot ſhew one who had not (as far as was in the King's Power to grant it.) And that much more than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at his Hands, by their own Confeſſion at this Day; and many of them do complain that their Grievances have not been ſo well Redreſſed ſince.</p>
            <p>And if King <hi>James</hi> can be repreſented by theſe Men as a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and <hi>a Bloody Perſecutor</hi> while he Courted them, and ſought by all winning Ways to gain them, (which was certainly the Caſe while he was among them in <hi>Ireland,</hi>) it may bring Men into ſuſpence to believe what is told of the <hi>French, Hungarian,</hi> or of any other Perſecution.</p>
            <p>But I will not Anticipate, what you will find in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Leaves, to which I refer you. Only I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to acquaint you, That <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. of this Anſwer, upon the Head of <hi>One Prince interpoſing between another Prince and his Subjects when he uſes them Cruelly,</hi> I refer to a Book, which I thought would have been Publiſhed as ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:59238:4"/>as this, and therefore ſaid little to that Point: But now that I ſee no Hopes of its coming out, give me leave to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large a little, and tell Dr. <hi>King</hi> what advantage the <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites</hi> make of this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>They ſay it would juſtifie King <hi>Lewis,</hi> or any other King to interpoſe between them and King <hi>William.</hi> For they pretend that they are much more Cruelly uſed by King <hi>William,</hi> than even Dr. <hi>King</hi> himſelf ſays the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were by King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> they tell us, That their <hi>Clergy</hi> are <hi>Deprived,</hi> that they are impriſoned without Law, for no other fault than Reading the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>They complain of Double Taxes, Exceſſive Fines and Bail, and Illegal Impriſonments.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>Ireland,</hi> beſides the <hi>Deprivation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> all Men and Women who refuſe the <hi>New Oaths</hi> incur a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they are Fined, Impriſoned, Maſſacred (as <hi>Glen-coe,</hi> &amp;c.) and put to the Torture, againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Claim of Right</hi> (as <hi>Nevil Pain,</hi> &amp;c.) their <hi>Clergy</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly <hi>Rabbled,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> Aboliſhed.</p>
            <p>Though, they ſay, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to <hi>Scotland,</hi> Dated at the <hi>Hague,</hi> 10. Octob. 88. Promiſes to preſerve their <hi>Church,</hi> as then Eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, <hi>From any Alteration:</hi> And makes that the chief End and Deſign of his then intended Expedition.</p>
            <p>Then they tell of the many wicked and illegal Courſes, which were taken to overturn the Foundations of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That when the Meeting of the Eſtates of <hi>Scotland</hi> was called by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Circular Letters, in <hi>March</hi> 89. none were ſent to ſeveral <hi>Royal Brughs</hi> in the <hi>North;</hi> which is the moſt <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> and conſequently the moſt Loyal part of <hi>Scotland:</hi> And therefore ſuch ſent no Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>That at the firſt Meeting of the Eſtates, they refuſed, when it was moved, to adjourn for eight Days, (as they did in <hi>England,</hi>) to give time to the Members from the
<pb facs="tcp:59238:4"/>remote parts of the <hi>North,</hi> to get to <hi>Edenbrugh:</hi> But did precipitate Matters before they came.</p>
            <p>That the Oaths required by Law to be taken by all the Members of Parliament, or any Judicature, before they can ſit or vote there, were, without Law, laid aſide: By which means the <hi>Anti-Monarchical,</hi> and <hi>Fanatical</hi> Party were let into the Houſe.</p>
            <p>That ſeveral, Noble-men, and Gentle-men, who had been Forefaulted for Treaſon, and ſo had no Property nor Intereſt in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were admitted as Members of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> before their Forfeitures were Reſcinded, even by this <hi>Convention;</hi> and ſo were made the King's Judges, to paſs Sentence of Forefaulture againſt him, for the Injuries which they pretended he had done to them. And that one of theſe (<hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>) was ſent with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> by Act of Convention, 24 <hi>Apr.</hi> 89. before his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulture was taken off, which was not done till, 1 <hi>Aug.</hi> 89. by the 4th Act of the firſt Seſſion of the firſt Parliament of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by theſe Means the <hi>Fanatical</hi> Party in that <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were the moſt Numerous: And framed ſuch a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Elections,</hi> as for any, or no Cauſe, turn'd out any Epiſcopal Member who came in Competition with one of their own.</p>
            <p>That by their Act 4 <hi>July</hi> 90. they reſcinded all the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faultures ſince the year 1665. and <hi>Monmouth</hi> by name, and <hi>Richard Rumbold</hi> an Engliſh-man, who was to have Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated King <hi>Charles</hi> II. at <hi>Rye-houſe,</hi> and in publick Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations in <hi>Scotland</hi> was taken notice of as the ſuppoſed Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of King <hi>Charles</hi> I.</p>
            <p>That within this Act of Grace were included all that were concerned in the publick and open Rebellions of <hi>Pentland-hills, Bothwell-brig, Monmouth,</hi> and <hi>Argyle;</hi> and the very Aſſaſſinates of the Lord Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> (thoſe <hi>Furies incarnate!</hi>) were all, as many as were alive, enabl'd to be Members of Parliament, and to paſs Sentence of Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulture againſt their King.</p>
            <p>That King <hi>William</hi> by his additional Inſtructions to his Commiſſioner Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> dated the 17th of <hi>July</hi> 89.
<pb facs="tcp:59238:5"/>empowers him to paſs Acts for Reſcinding all Foreſaultures ſince 1660.</p>
            <p>But this exceeded the Modeſty even of that Parliament! They would not <hi>expreſly</hi> own that no Treaſon could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt K. C 2. or K. <hi>J.</hi> 2. at the ſame time that they Deprived and Foreſaulted ſo many on the behalf of K. <hi>W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Fanatical Mob,</hi> who had Rabbled the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy, were Armed, and made the Guard of that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> and reſolved to ſacrifice any who durſt oppoſe their Deſigns; witneſs Sir <hi>George Mackenzy,</hi> that great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of his Nation and Profeſſion, who was forced to fly from their Fury, to ſave his Life, it being made appear they had laid Plots to murder Him and Others. They tore <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Miniſters Gowns off their backs in the ſtreets of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> where the <hi>Convention</hi> ſate, and attacked the Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> there.</p>
            <p>That the Biſhops, who are the Firſt of the Three Eſtates of Parliament, were excluded from ſitting in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before they were a Parliament, by vertue of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſent from King <hi>William</hi> to his Commiſſioner Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> dated 31 <hi>May</hi> 89. in theſe words: <hi>You are to paſs an Act turning the Meeting of Eſtates into a Parliament; and that the Three Eſtates are to conſiſt of the Noblemen, Barons, and Burgeſſes.</hi> Accordingly the Meeting of Eſtates wherein the Biſhops ſate, was turned into a Parliament, 5 <hi>June</hi> 89. the Biſhops being firſt excluded; which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> think a material Objection againſt the validity of all the Acts of that Parliament, particularly that of 22 <hi>July</hi> 89. aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and the Act 7 <hi>June</hi> 90. ſetling <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church-Government.</p>
            <p>Whence the <hi>Jacobite Epiſcoparians</hi> deſire us to take a view of the Methods how their Church was over-turned.</p>
            <p>They firſt tell us, That the major part of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and much the greater part of the Nobility and Gentry, are <hi>Epiſcopal;</hi> and therefore that <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> would carry it in any fair and free Convention of the Eſtates in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That ſeveral Reaſons are given above, why it was not ſo in the late Convention there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59238:5"/>That the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Managers did inſtigate and ſet on their Rabble to fall upon the Epiſcopal Clergy, and drive them by violence from their Churches; and that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Miniſters who had preached in thoſe Pariſhes by a Toleration from King <hi>James,</hi> ſhould take poſſeſſion of them before the Meeting of the Eſtates, where they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to excuſe the Rabble, and continue the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and likewiſe make uſe of this as an Argument, That <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was contrary to the <hi>inclinations of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Rabbling</hi> began in <hi>December</hi> 88. and to make way for it, a Report was induſtriouſly ſpread abroad (as in <hi>England</hi>) That ſome Thouſands of <hi>Iriſh</hi> were landed in <hi>Galloway,</hi> and marching forward with Fire and Sword: Upon which, the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> took Arms, and fell upon the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Clergy with a Violence that is hardly credible.</p>
            <p>That they drove them from their Churches, plundered their Houſes, aſſaulted their Perſons, pricking ſome with Bodkins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till they have gone diſtracted; in which miſerable condition a Gentleman told me he met an old Companion of his at the College, an Epiſcopal Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had been thus ſerved by that Rabble.</p>
            <p>That they turned the Wives and Children of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy out of their Houſes, to ſhift as they could; upon which many of their Children dy'd, and their Wives miſcarried. A <hi>Presbyterian</hi> (but who abhorr'd the Bruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of theſe Proceedings) told me, that he was at the Rabbling at <hi>Air,</hi> and ſaw an Epiſcopal Miniſter's Wife, who had been but three or four days delivered, turned out with her Children into the Streets, and all People ſhut their Doors upon them, inſomuch that this Gentleman, mov'd with ſo lamentable a Spectacle, beſtirr'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Compaſſion to them; and that it was Eleven at Night before he could get a poor Cabbin to give them ſhelter.</p>
            <p>That they uſed to lead the Miniſters about in Triumph, tearing their Gowns, which they called <hi>the Rags of the Whore;</hi> and burning the <hi>Book of Common Prayer</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they could find it, calling it <hi>the Maſs in Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Weſtern Fanatick Rabble,</hi> who began their Work upon <hi>Chriſtmas Day,</hi> to be witty in their Malice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59238:6"/>That at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> it ſelf the Tumult was ſo high, that the <hi>Mob</hi> forced the King's Palace, rifted the Chancellor's Lodgings, gutted the Chappel (deſigned for the Order of the Knights of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>) carried the King's Picture to the Mercat-Croſs, and there publickly ſtabb'd and tore it, with the like Indignities as ſome ungrateful and bruitiſh Villains expreſs'd, in the rancor of their Hearts, againſt the King's Statue at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That upon theſe violent Diſorders, the King being gone from <hi>England,</hi> and no ſettled Government in the Nation, the <hi>College of Juſtice</hi> at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> took Arms, and kept Watch and Ward, to ſecure the Peace of the City, and their <hi>Clergy</hi> from being <hi>Rabbled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That then a Proclamation came from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> commanding all perſons to lay down their Arms; That the <hi>College of Juſtice</hi> did thereupon lay down their Arms; but the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> did not, for they ſaid, that they knew the Order was not intended againſt them; and they proceeded to greater Inſults againſt the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi> and fell upon thoſe they had not medled with before, and a Tumult was raiſed at <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Rabbled Clergy</hi> who thought themſelves protected by the Prince's Proclamation, and thereupon returned to their Churches and Livings, were much more rudely treated than before; and particular Favours were granted to the Town of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> by 15 Act of 2 Seſſ. of 1 Parl. of <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> for the <hi>Zeal of the Community of the ſaid City</hi> (who were the principal Rabblers) <hi>for the Proteſtant Religion,</hi> as it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Act.</p>
            <p>That the Rabbled Clergy made application to the P. of O. for Protection from this Outrage, and ſent Dr. <hi>Scot,</hi> Dean of <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> who, aſſiſted by Dr. <hi>Fall,</hi> Principal of the College of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> did repreſent their deplorable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Highneſs; who gave them no other Anſwer than to refer them to the <hi>Meeting of the Eſtates,</hi> which did not aſſemble till 14 <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
            <p>That they, ſuffering unſpeakable Hardſhips and Indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties all that time, from <hi>December</hi> to <hi>March,</hi> made the ſame Requeſt for Protection from the Rabble to the <hi>Meeting of Eſtates</hi> then convened. In anſwer to which,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59238:6"/>That the <hi>Meeting of Eſtates,</hi> by their Act 13 <hi>Apr.</hi> 89. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Protection of the Goverument all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who had been Rabbled before that day, and were not then in Poſſeſſion of their Churches: And being turned into a <hi>Parliament,</hi> by their Act 7 <hi>June</hi> 90. declared, That theſe Rabbled Miniſters had Deſerted their Churches; and therefore adjudged them to be <hi>Vacant,</hi> and ordered thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters who, without any Law, had taken poſſeſſion of them when the Incumbents were driven away by the Rabble, <hi>to continue their poſſeſſion, and have Right to the Benefices and Stipends, according to their entry in the Year 89. viz.</hi> when the Incumbents were Rabbled. And to this, being an Act of Parliament, the Royal Aſſent was given.</p>
            <p>That theſe Miniſters Rabbled before 13 <hi>Apr.</hi> 89. and for that only reaſon declared to have <hi>abdicated</hi> by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were about 300.</p>
            <p>That the foreſaid Act 13. <hi>Apr.</hi> 89. obliged all that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Pray for K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> as King and Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and read a Proclamation publickly from their Pulpits againſt the owning of King <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that they might not have too long time to conſider of it, it was to be read, under pain of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> the next day, <hi>viz.</hi> 14 <hi>Apr.</hi> 89. by all the Miniſters of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 21ſt by all on that ſide the River <hi>Tay,</hi> on the 28th by all be-north <hi>Tay,</hi> which was hardly time to have the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation tranſmitted to them all. At <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation came not from the Preſs till late on <hi>Saturday</hi> night, and it was to be read at Morning-Service next day: ſo that many of them, it is ſuppoſed, had not an hours time to reſolve.</p>
            <p>That this ſevere Act was more ſeverely executed by the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> then Preſident of the Council, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Lords; and that near as many were turn'd out by the <hi>Rabble within doors,</hi> as the <hi>Field-Rabble</hi> had done.</p>
            <p>That Matters being thus prepared for total Abolition of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> all haſte was made to do it: An Act was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for that purpoſe, and Inſtructions were ſent to the Commiſſioner in theſe words: <hi>You are to Touch the Act al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed,</hi> Aboliſhing Epiſcopacy, <hi>as ſoon as you can; and
<pb facs="tcp:59238:7"/>to Reſcind all Acts inconſiſtent therewith;</hi> That the haſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired was obſerved, for theſe Inſtructions were ſigned by King <hi>William</hi> at <hi>Whitehall</hi> the 17th of <hi>July</hi> 89. and the Act was Touched at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 22d of the ſame month.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus fell</hi> Epiſcopacy <hi>in</hi> Scotland! Two Months and eleven Days after King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> took upon them the Crown of that Kingdom, which was the <hi>eleventh</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 89.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters, who were ejected by Law, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. upon the Reſtoration of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> were reſtored to the <hi>Churches</hi> they had before, by Act of this Parliament, 25 <hi>April</hi> 90. without any Proviſion made for thoſe who were ejected.</p>
            <p>That they did not pretend to that Regard to any who ſhould be Deprived, as the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> ſeemed to do, by allowing <hi>Twelve</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> who ſhould refuſe the Oaths, the Third of their Biſhopricks or Livings during their Life; and left it to K. <hi>W.</hi> to apply it to which <hi>Twelve</hi> of them he thought fit: But that he has applied it to none, leſt they ſhould fare better than their Deprived Brethren in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That not only thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters who were outed by the Biſhops, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. but even thoſe who had been Depoſed and put under Cenſure as Incendiaries and wicked Men, <hi>by their own Presbyterian Synods,</hi> Anno 1660, and 1661. without being releaſed from thoſe Cenſures by any Synod, or Eccleſiaſtical Authority of their own, were Reſtored <hi>Anno</hi> 1690. by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>That theſe, as being moſt violent, were moſt eſteem'd: and one of them, Mr. <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> was made Moderator of the General Aſſembly, <hi>Anno</hi> 1690. while he lay under the Cenſure of their own <hi>Kirk,</hi> which was not taken off till the end of that ſame Aſſembly. That thus their <hi>Church</hi> was eſtabliſhed by Men thruſt out of their <hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>State</hi> by Men Forefaulted by the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That by Act of their Parliament, 7 <hi>June</hi> 90. <hi>Setling Presbyterian Church Government,</hi> the whole Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Authority is placed in the hands of thoſe Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Miniſters outed ſince the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1661. (who were not then above Fifty or Sixty in number), and ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:59238:7"/>as they ſhould admit, excluſive of all other Presbyters; which was a greater Superiority ſettled in one Presbyter above another, than that which they Aboliſhed in the Biſhops as an <hi>inſupportable Grievance.</hi> And theſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modell'd Presbyters, inveſted with Epiſcopal Power, in Oppoſition to Epiſcopacy, did exerciſe it with a Tyranny and Lordlineſs the Biſhops had never ſhewn: For, being by a particular Clauſe in that Act enabled, by themſelves, or whom they ſhould appoint, <hi>to try and purge out all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, negligent, ſcandalous and erroneous Miniſters,</hi> they erected Tribunals in every Presbytery, as <hi>arbitrary,</hi> but more <hi>ſenſeleſs,</hi> than the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and did but one good Act, to purge out thoſe Epiſcopal Presbyters, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with their <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Uſurpation;</hi> for which they could never want a pretence, becauſe <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Collation</hi> from <hi>Prelates</hi> was always made one Article in their Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thought <hi>erroneous</hi> enough to ſpew any out of their Churches.</p>
            <p>But as to theſe Deprived Clergy, I muſt here take notice of a diſtinction much uſed in <hi>England</hi> to mollifie <hi>Lay-Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;</hi> viz. That the Biſhops and Clergy Deprived by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> loſe not their Character, only are barr'd by the <hi>Secular Power</hi> to exerciſe it in ſuch Diſtricts.</p>
            <p>But Act 35. of Seſſ. 2. of the firſt Parliament of <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> thoſe Miniſters who did not Pray for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and were therefore De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd, were afterwards prohibited to <hi>preach or exerciſe any part of the Miniſterial Function, either in Churches, or elſewhere, upon any pretext whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 38th Act of the ſame Seſſion, they do as much confound our State-diſtinction of <hi>de Facto</hi> and <hi>de Jure;</hi> which, they ſay, is <hi>cunningly of late ſpread abroad, to weaken and invalidate the Allegiance ſworn to their Majeſties;</hi> And therefore they order a Certificate to be ſubſcrib'd by all who take the Oath, declaring K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> to be King and Queen as well <hi>de Jure</hi> as <hi>de Facto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they ſay, That in all theſe things they have dealt more frankly and plainly, if not more honeſtly and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than we have done in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59238:8"/>They think it more fair and open Dealing, plainly to <hi>Foreſault</hi> the King for <hi>Male-adminiſtration,</hi> than to <hi>Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> him for flying to ſave his Life.</p>
            <p>And when he is gone, that he ſhould not take the <hi>Right</hi> to the Crown along with him, and leave K. <hi>W.</hi> nothing but a <hi>de Facto</hi> Poſſeſſion; which they think a Betraying K. <hi>W.</hi> to the laſt Degree, and making him no better than an <hi>Uſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They think it the ſame thing to debar Clergy-men from the Exerciſe of the Miniſterial Function, as to leave them no Place to exerciſe it in.</p>
            <p>And as Charitable to allow nothing to the <hi>Depriv'd,</hi> as to name ſomething for them, and put it into Hands where they are ſure never to come by it.</p>
            <p>But I know not ſo well how they'll ſolve that Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſeems to be betwixt their <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> 11 Ap. 89. and their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Ratified and Eſtabliſhed, Act 5. of 2 Seſſ. 1 Parl. <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> Read over in their Preſence, and inſerted <hi>Verbatim</hi> in the Body of the Act.</p>
            <p>The Claim of Right begins in theſe Words, <hi>Whereas King</hi> James, <hi>being a profeſt</hi> Papiſt, <hi>did aſſume the Regal Power,</hi> &amp;c. And the firſt of their Claims is in theſe Words,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That by the Law of this Kingdom no</hi> Papiſt <hi>can be King or Queen of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet in the aboveſaid <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Chap. 23. It is Decreed and Eſtabliſhed as the true Chriſtian Doctrine, in theſe Words; <hi>viz. Infidelity or Difference in Religion doth not make void the Magiſtrates juſt and legal Authority, nor free the People from their due Obedience to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I muſt not exceed the bounds of a Preface. For if I ſhould only Name all the Hardſhips and Oppreſſions, the illegal and arbitrary Proceedings of which the <hi>Jacobites</hi> complain of in <hi>Scotland,</hi> &amp; ſay they are ready to make good by undeniable Vouchers, I ſhould ſwell this beyond the Bulk of Dr. <hi>King</hi>'s Book; and that the <hi>Truths</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> would, if poſſible, out-number the <hi>Falſtoods</hi> he relates of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for a fuller Account of theſe <hi>Scots</hi> Affairs, I refer you to a ſmall Tract, called, <hi>A Letter to a Friend, giving

            <p>Suppoſe, ſay they, it were true which Dr. <hi>King</hi> aſſerts, as it is moſt falſe, That K. <hi>James</hi> while he was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did endeavour totally to overthrow the Church Eſtabliſhed by Law there, and ſet up that which was moſt agreeable to the Inclinations of the major Number of the People in that Kingdom, who are <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> The <hi>Jacobites</hi> ask if this were ſo, Whether it be not fully vindicated in the 4th Inſtruction of thoſe which King <hi>William</hi> ſent to his Commiſſioner in <hi>Scotland,</hi> dated at <hi>Copt-Hall,</hi> 31.

And <hi>p.</hi> 191. where I take notice of his Compariſon betwixt King <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, and according to his Repreſentation of them, I ask, <hi>Whether any would have King</hi> James <hi>to be worſe than the</hi> French <hi>King?</hi> That is, than that Character with which ſome take Pains to blacken the <hi>French Monarch:</hi> But we know now what ſtreſs is to be laid upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, by the many falſe and malicious Slanders which they have ſpread abroad, and vouch'd with as much Confidence, of their own King, and of Matters done within our own Country.</p>
            <p>It is not juſt to frame an Idea of any Man, by that Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantation of him which is given by his Enemy.</p>
            <p>And yet no King that ever was in the World has had his Praiſes ſung to a greater pitch by the moſt flattering Poet, than the <hi>French King</hi>'s moſt bitter Enemies have extalled him, even while they were ſpitting Venom at him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Prince,</hi> ſays the Mighty <hi>Cant.</hi> in his laſt Thankſgiving-Sermon before K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> 27 <hi>Octob.</hi> 92. who governs his Affairs <hi>by the deepest and the ſteadiest Councils, and the moſt refin'd Wiſdom of this World! A Prince Mighty and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his Preparations for War; Formidable for his vaſt and well-diſciplin'd Armies, and for his great Naval Force; and who hath brought the Art of War almoſt to that Perfection, as to be able to Conquer, and do his Buſineſs without Fighting: A Myſtery hardly known to former Ages and Generations!</hi> And laſtly, that he has <hi>an almoſt-inexhauſtible Treaſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps he ſaid all this with a Proſpect of ſtanding him in ſtead another day.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Roman Caeſar</hi>'s Greatneſs, or God-like Power and Wiſdom, was ever ſet out in a higher ſtrain than this? Nay, he makes the <hi>French Caeſar</hi> exceed in the <hi>Art of War</hi> all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages and Generations.</p>
            <p>And for his <hi>Civil Government</hi> within his own Kingdom, ſuppreſſing and effectually curing <hi>Duels, Robberies,</hi> and other publick Vices which were moſt rooted in <hi>France</hi> for immemorial Generations, it is the Amazement and envy'd Pattern of his Neighbor-Nations, and really the greateſt and moſt noble of all his Victories.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59238:10"/>How does every one that comes over tell us, That Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers may carry Gold open through all <hi>France,</hi> without danger of any Robbers? But as ſoon as you ſet your foot upon <hi>Spaniſh Flanders,</hi> you muſt prepare to fight your way, to be Robb'd, or Murder'd. And in <hi>England</hi> we all too well know, that none now are ſecure, neither on the High-way, nor in their Houſes, from Thieves and Robbers.</p>
            <p>There is one Objection againſt this Great King, which makes it an Offence to many to hear any thing, though Truth, ſpoken to his Advantage; and that is, Baniſhing the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Miniſters, and <hi>Dragooning</hi> others, to work them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Religion; which does, and juſtly, eclipſe his Glory, with thoſe who know not the true Grounds and Motives which induc'd him to Methods ſo rigid and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</p>
            <p>But his very Enemies, who know the Reaſons he had for it, do even in this Excuſe him, and turn it into an Argument of his wiſe Foreſight and Prudence. They tell you that he was under an invincible Neceſſity of being rid of theſe Men, or hazarding ſuch a Revolution as befel King <hi>James.</hi> That <hi>he knew they would endanger him by a Revolt, if he were Invaded by a Proteſtant Prince:</hi> Which are the very Words of the Anſwer to <hi>Great, Britain</hi>'s <hi>Juſt Complaint,</hi> pag. 47. That their <hi>Refugees</hi> here do generally all own the Principle of <hi>Reſiſtance.</hi> And that their <hi>Miniſters</hi> march'd, laſt Campaign, before the Army into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> Preaching to the People as they went the lawfulneſs of taking Arms againſt their King. This is a plain Demonſtration what the Anſwer to <hi>Britain</hi>'s <hi>Complaint</hi> has told us.</p>
            <p>The French King being thus vindicated by his Enemies in that which was moſt colourably Objected againſt him, and which, if not done upon the aboveſaid Motives, would leave him inexcuſable. The <hi>Jacobites</hi> think themſelves for ever oblig'd to acknowlege with all Gratefulneſs the Noble and Generous Reception he has given to King <hi>James</hi> in his Diſtreſs, which as no King in <hi>Europe</hi> was able to have done but Himſelf; ſo none but he could have done it in ſuch a manner, with that Greatneſs, and every Punctilio of Honor; which if all the particulars were repeated, would fill a Volume, and is ſuch an <hi>Original</hi> as is not to be
<pb facs="tcp:59238:10"/>found in former Ages, and will be Recorded in Hiſtory, as the moſt glorious Scene of his Life: And that if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what he has ſo Heroically undertaken the <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſay, he will not find readier Trumpeters of his Glory than the preſent Complying Divines, <hi>late of the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</p>
            <p>They would in that Day reſume their old Theams, with which their Pulpits us'd to ring, but are now forgotten, of the Perſecutions of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by thoſe <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes, who are now in <hi>Confederacy</hi> with <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>France.</hi> They would then tell us of the declar'd Principle of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> not to ſuffer any <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom they call <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> to live within their Dominions: And purſuant to that, have Erected the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> which occaſioned the great Revolution in the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> They wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t which is above told for the <hi>French</hi> King's dealing with the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and yet that their Perſecutions were much more grievous. The <hi>French</hi> King only Baniſhed the <hi>Hugonot Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters:</hi> the preſent <hi>Emperor</hi> ſent to the <hi>Gallies</hi> all the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All this, and more, we ſhould hear, if ſuch a turn came, from theſe Verſatile Trimming-Court-Divines: Or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they judg'd it to comply with their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Their Carriage in this Revolution, has given greater occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaſpheme, and turn'd more Men from the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and even to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> has overturned, ruined, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and diſhonored our Church more than if that Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ſome feard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or pretended, had fallen upon 'em.

<pb facs="tcp:59238:11"/>over the three Kingdoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fill their Hearts with greater averſion to <hi>Popery?</hi> And none believe it would have Eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the eſtabliſhed <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> not ſhaken it in <hi>England,</hi> ſo much as is now done by the preſent <hi>Schiſm.</hi> No, ſay the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> it would have Rooted and Confirmed it, the more the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> Councils ſhould endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it; for, as Dr. <hi>King</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>Perſecution</hi> never hurts <hi>Religion</hi> but <hi>Rebellion</hi> deſtroys it: And he once thought <hi>it would be a glorious Sight</hi> (to uſe his own Phraſe) <hi>to ſee a Cart full of Clergy men going to the Stake,</hi> for aſſerting the Principles of their Religion.</p>
            <p>How much more glorious indeed, than to ſee them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canting and Preaching down their former Principles, and Proclaming it out of their own Mouths, that they have been <hi>falſe Teachers</hi> all their Days before this Turn; or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that they are ſo now, to ſerve a Turn!

            </p>
            <p>It is in the Power of none to ruin the Church of <hi>England,</hi> While it remains true to its ſelf.</p>
            <p>I have done, when I have deſired the Reader not to think that I am inſenſible of ſeveral ill Steps, which were made in the Adminiſtration of Affairs under the Government of K. <hi>J.</hi> Nor do I deſign to leſſen them, or make other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for them, than by doing him this Juſtice to tell what the <hi>Jacobites</hi> offer to prove, and make it Notorious; <hi>viz.</hi> That the greateſt Blots in his Government were hit by thoſe who made them, with deſign to ruin him, and now boaſt it as their Merit, and are Rewarded for it.</p>
            <p>And though Dr <hi>King</hi> repreſents him to be of ſo Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Implacable a Temper towards the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yet that it is now publickly known that the fatal Meaſures he took, were adviſed, and often preſſed, beyond, and againſt his Majeſty's inclinations and Opinion, by thoſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom his unexampled and even faulty Clemency had not only Pardoned, for all their bitter Virulency in oppoſing his Succeſſion, but brought them into his moſt ſecret Councils, and acted by their Advice.</p>
            <p>This was the Burden of the Charge laid againſt him
<pb facs="tcp:59238:11"/>in the P. of O's Declaration; <hi>viz</hi> Employing ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and acting by their Advice: And though our Law ſays, <hi>That the King can do no wrong,</hi> and therefore that his <hi>Miniſters</hi> only are accountable; yet, as Mr. <hi>Sam.

            <p>THIS Book I am about to Anſwer, does not only undertake to Vindicate thoſe <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whoſe Cauſe it defends, from the Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rebellion</hi> in this preſent <hi>Revolution;</hi> and, as the Ground-work of their juſtification, to caſt the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Aſperſions upon King <hi>James:</hi> But, if I can Reaſon aright, it is calculated for the Doſtruction of <hi>Mankind,</hi> by ſetting up ſuch Principles as countenance Eternal Rebellions, and afford Pretences for War and Confuſion to the end of the World; and makes <hi>Settlement</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> impracticable among Men.</p>
            <p>If this Charge can be made good, (for which I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to what follows) then the Pains I have taken muſt be computed not only as a Juſt Vindication of K. <hi>J.</hi> from thoſe Aſperſions which are falſly laid upon Him, but as a Service to Mankind, to theſe Nations in an eſpecial manner, who, of late Ages, have moſt of all the Nations on the Earth, been ſubject to <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Revolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if that has been chiefly occaſion'd by ſuch Principles as are ſet out in this Book, then the Diſcovery may be of uſe to thoſe who are ſtill purſuing of them blindfold; and a Caution to others not to engage, to the Deſtruction of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> or if engaged, to <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>Return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Learned Men think their Time and Labours well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in rectifying Miſtakes in Ancient Hiſtories, meerly for the <hi>Truths</hi> ſake; much more is it incumbent on us to examin into thoſe Matters of Fact by which we guide our preſent Actions, and for which we ſhall be accountable at the Day of Judgment; as likewiſe, that we ſuffer not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths and Falſe Repreſentations to deſcend to Poſterity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59238:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>unreproved, eſpecially of our own Natural Kings, whoſe <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> we are in Conſcience obliged to Defend as well as their <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſo far as is conſiſtent with Truth: and to be ſilent in ſuch a Caſe, is bearing Falſe Witneſs, at leaſt virtually, and <hi>ſlandering the Footſteps of God's Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>K. <hi>James</hi> has been loaded with more Calumny by <hi>this Author,</hi> than in all the ſcurrilous Pamphlets ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution put together; which is the Reaſon this Book of his has been ſo induſtriouſly propagated, (it goes now in its <hi>Fourth</hi> Edition;) and his other <hi>Narrative</hi> and <hi>bitter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective,</hi> called a <hi>Thanksgiving-Sermon</hi> (of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak) has been ſpread in all ſhapes and ſizes through the Nation, from a <hi>Quarto,</hi> to a Two-penny <hi>Duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will detain you no longer, nor ſeek to anticipate your Judgment.</p>
            <p>I divide this Book of our Author's into his <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Matters of Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diviſion of the Book into Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact. His Principles hard to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Not ſet down in Method.</note>Firſt, For his <hi>Principles.</hi> It is no eaſie Matter to know what they are: For tho his Book is digeſted into great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of Method, that is not as to his <hi>Principles,</hi> which he no where ſets down in plain and expreſs Terms, but leaves us to collect them from ſmall <hi>Hints</hi> and <hi>Inuendo's,</hi> which are ſcattered immethodically up and down his Book. And this was not done by chance, but he was aſham'd all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to diſown his former Principles, <hi>nemo repente</hi>—It is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for Men to endeavour not to be thought Changeable and Unconſtant, and to hide or gloſs it all they can. This we may reaſonably ſuppoſe to be our Author's Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">They are the old Commonwealth Principles.</note>For the Principles which he exhibits, yet endeavours to conceal, in this Book, are all the old Rotten, Rebel, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth Principles, which we formerly exploded in <hi>De Jure Regni, Rex Lex,</hi> and other <hi>Fanatical</hi> Authors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in the <hi>Decretum Oxoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſe,</hi> and the Univerſal Current of the Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by none more than this Author, as you will ſee hereafter.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is not to be wonder'd that he lets theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his, which he has ſo lately embrac'd, drop from him in a covert way, as if they were not clean, and would foul his Fingers. Yet ſomething he muſt ſay to them, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59238:13"/>clear his Paſſage, The Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> muſt be remov'd. To perform which he employs his Introduction, page 1. containing, as he tells us, an <hi>Explication of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Paſſive Obedience, and ſtating the true Notion and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of it.</hi> And yet he does nothing elſe in it, but to tell us what ſome People thought of it: He begins, <hi>It is granted by ſome,</hi>— and then gives three or four Quotations, without telling his own opinion, otherwiſe than as you may gather it from his more favourable Repreſenting one ſide than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the Heads of the Diſcourſe he promiſes much fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than you find the Performance in the Book. Numb. 1. of the Introduction is, <hi>That a King who deſigns to deſtroy a People abdicates the Government of them.</hi> Which Poſition does need a great deal of Explication, and ſtating the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Latitude of it; becauſe a miſtake in it would prove of moſt deſtructive conſequence. But our Author leaves it all in the Generals, make of it what you can.</p>
            <p>By what I can collect out of him his principle is the ſame with <hi>Bradſhau,</hi> in his Speech upon the Tryal of King <hi>Ch.</hi> I. <hi>viz.</hi> That all Power is from the People: That Kings are but their Deputies; and therefore are accountable to the People, and may be depoſed by them.</p>
            <p>Againſt this Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> inveights moſt bitterly, in his Sermon before the Houſe of Commons laſt 30th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 91. page 18. where he reckons it, <q>as one of the moſt Fatal Evils of ſuch Examples, as that of the day, that it infects Mens Minds with looſe Notions of Government and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which are at firſt invented to juſtifie ſuch Actions, and which People are ſooner taught than untaught: As that all Power is radically in the People, and therefore but a Truſt, which a Prince muſt give an Account of, which he may be deprived of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And pag. 23. he ſays of theſe Principles, <q>That they have poiſoned the very Springs and Fountains of Government, and ſo deeply tinctur'd Mens Minds, that he prays God we may not ſtill live to ſee the miſerable Effects of it.</q> Thus Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> even ſince his <hi>Converſion.</hi> But you may ſay, how does it appear that this Author now ſets up theſe Principles? You ſhall be Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59238:14"/>Pag. 49. he ſays, <hi>That it is ill truſting any one</hi> (any King) <hi>with ſuch a Power.</hi> This is in his c. 3. ſ. 1. n. 8.</p>
            <p>Again, c. 1. n. 10. p. 11. he expreſſes himſelf in theſe Words, <hi>viz. The antient Government with which he</hi> (the King) <hi>was intruſted,</hi> p. 41. he falls upon thoſe who ſtopt the Bill of Excluſion with this wholſome Advice, <hi>Never to truſt Men</hi> of King <hi>James</hi>'s Principles <hi>and</hi> Religion <hi>with a Power that may deſtroy us.</hi> Here the King's <hi>Power</hi> is onely what the People pleaſe to truſt him with.<note place="margin">Pag. 57.</note> He ſays, <hi>That it is not the King's Money that pays the Soldiers, but the Kingdoms;</hi> and thence it will follow, that they are not the King's Soldiers, but the Kingdoms.<note place="margin">67.</note> He ſays, <hi>That every Law is certainly a Compact between the King and the People, wherein by a mutual Conſent they agree on a Rule by which he is to govern, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which they oblige themſelves to pay him Obedience: That therefore the People may as lawfully diſpence with their Allegiance to the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">68.</note> 
               <hi>as the King diſpence with the Execution of a Law. That the Subjects have no other Security for their Liberties,</hi>
               <note place="margin">77.</note> 
               <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and Lives, except the Intereſt they have of chuſing their own Repreſentatives in Parliament.</hi> Whereby he will exclude by very much the greateſt part of the Nation from having any ſecurity for their Lives, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> all but the Electors of Parliament men; for none other have any Vote in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their own Repreſentatives. But the Author makes them amends, by giving every one of them a power to diſpence with their Allegiance to the King, when ever they think that the King diſpences with the Execution of any Law. He makes them all <hi>Popes,</hi> to diſpence with Oaths, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duty, when they think it reaſonable. And as he gives them Power over their Oaths of Allegiance, ſo he does o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the King's Treaſury and Army. It is <hi>Their</hi> Mony, <hi>Their</hi> Army, and why ſhould not <hi>They</hi> command them? The King himſelf acts but by their Commiſſion, and by all Rule and Right, every Man is accountable to him from whom he has his Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>But now our Author is upon the Rode, you ſhall ſee how he improves,<note place="margin">He derives the <hi>Eccleſ. Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> from the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> p. 206.</note> he ſtops at nothing. And ſince he is a granting to the <hi>People, they</hi> ſhall have all, even <hi>the Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which is truſted in the Crown,</hi> ſhall be derived from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59238:14"/>the People, and transferrable by them to whom they think fit. For he makes King <hi>James</hi>'s breach of truſt <hi>in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Authority</hi> a provoking temptation <hi>to his People</hi> to think of <hi>transferring</hi> it to ſome other Perſon. This will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the <hi>Phanaticks</hi> as well as <hi>Commonwealth-men,</hi> That even the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Authority is derived from the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">His Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of its not being Lawful upon any Pretence to take Arms againſt the King, &amp;c. pag. 221. n. 3.</note>And now to Crown all, He gives as large and looſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of that famous Principle of the Ch. of <hi>England, viz.</hi> of <hi>its not being Lawful upon any Pretence whatever to take Arms againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Bradſhaw, Rutherford, Bellarmin,</hi> or <hi>Mariana</hi> could deſire. <hi>viz.</hi> He ſays it was only meant, <hi>That private Men ſhould not take up the Sword, or reſiſt the King upon any Pretence;</hi> that is, ſays he, <hi>upon any Pretence of private Injury, or Wrong done to them in particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beyond this, none of the <hi>Republicans, Phanaticks,</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in the World could go. So that this was no very <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Principle of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as we us'd to call it.</p>
            <p>But if you will allow the ſame Parliament which enacted the aboveſaid Principle of Non-Reſiſtance to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to underſtand their own Meaning, or think that the declared Senſe of the Legiſlators is the true Senſe of the Law, then our Author has widely miſtaken his Mark, and misinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Law. For 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. c. 30. it is declared, <hi>That neither the Peers nor Commons, nor both together, nor the People, Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively nor Repreſentatively, in Parliament or out of Parliament, nor any other Perſons whatſoever, have any Coercive Power over the Kings of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Now judge, whether all this is meant only of <hi>Private Men?</hi> as our Author would make you believe.</p>
            <p>And take Notice, that this is not to be taken as a Grant from that Parliament; It is a <hi>Recognition,</hi> wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what was the Law before them: And they vouch, that this Prerogative of the King, to be exempt from all Coercive Power, is by <hi>the undoubted and fundamental Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> And that neither Lords nor Commons, nor any other Perſons, not only <hi>now</hi> have not, or <hi>hereafter</hi> ſhall not have any ſuch Power over the King, but that they <hi>never had,</hi> or ever <hi>ought to have</hi> ſuch Power.</p>
            <p>I hope our Author will confeſs, That this is ſomewhat a greater Authority, and ought to have greater Weight with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59238:15"/>us, than his ſingle Opinion, which he has taken up but of late.</p>
            <p>And to confound that Diſtinction of the Parliament being <hi>Coordinate</hi> with the King, and making the King but one of the three Eſtates, which would imply their having ſomething to do with the <hi>Sword</hi> (which is the Supreme Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) joyntly with the King, and therefore in ſome Caſes might reſtrain him by Force (which was the Pretence in 41.) to obviate all this, the <hi>Militia</hi> (which is the Sword of <hi>England</hi>) is by Act of Parliament put in the Hands of the King <hi>alone;</hi> And it is declared in expreſs Words, 13 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. That <hi>the Sword is ſolely in the King's Power, and that neither one nor both Houſes of Parliament can, or Lawfully may, Raiſe or Levy any War offenſive or defenſive againſt his Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Title of this Section, p. 221. is, <hi>King</hi> James, <hi>and his Party, endeavoured to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion, by miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the Perſons and Principles of Proteſtants.</hi> But it is not in the Power of <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> or any you can imagine, to miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Proteſtant Principles more than this Author in this ſame Section, as you have ſeen; that is, if you will allow that the Proteſtants did ever repreſent them Right before.</p>
            <p>And whereas he Objects, in the foremention'd Place, <hi>That by it</hi> (the aboveſaid Principle of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance) it was never intended to give up the Conſtitution of the Government, or to part with the Liberties and Privileges of the Kingdom.</hi> The Anſwer is very eaſy; for by the Judgment of what he calls the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> of the Government, <hi>viz.</hi> King and Parliament, <hi>That Principle</hi> is the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Government, and conſequently, they are the Men that break the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the Government, who Declare or Act againſt that <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> And as for the <hi>Liberties and Privileges of the Kingdom,</hi> no doubt the Wiſdom of the Kingdom in Parliament thought their Liberties and Privileges better preſerved by that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, than by the contrary of letting the People take Arms againſt the Government, when-ever they thought themſelves agrieved. They had experience of both; and we muſt believe they conſider'd the Matter very well. And that it ought not to be ſhaken by the Authority of this Author, who is ſo young in this Opinion, that he knows not by which handle to take it; at leaſt, he will not let us know. For
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59238:15"/>he tells us not his Scheme of Government, nor pitches upon any of thoſe, which are already ſet up, by thoſe of his <hi>New Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Several Schemes of Government.</note>Of which ſome lay the <hi>Foundation</hi> of all Government upon the <hi>Municipal Laws</hi> of the Land; ſo that if a King goes about to break the <hi>Laws,</hi> he thereby forfeits his Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others think, That <hi>Laws,</hi> which are the <hi>Reſult</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Government: However, that it is not to be alleg'd in a Country where the Law it ſelf makes it unlawful to Reſiſt the King. Which Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> has materially urg'd in his Letter to my Lord <hi>Ruſſel.</hi> See the Appendix, n. 14.</p>
            <p>Others therefore fly higher, to <hi>Original Contract,</hi> which is ſuppos'd to be prior to all <hi>Municipal Laws;</hi> and on which all <hi>Laws</hi> muſt depend.</p>
            <p>But others again think this Plea to be too precarious; and that it cannot be ſufficiently prov'd. And therefore they chuſe another ſort of a way, which they call <hi>Abdication.</hi> Which ſome think as perplex'd as any of the reſt, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there is a wiſer Set, who think it moſt convenient to be always on the <hi>ſtronger Side;</hi> and therefore they cry up <hi>Succeſs</hi> as a <hi>Divine Right.</hi> They have only one point of Prudence to obſerve, not to Turn too ſoon, leaſt they miſtake <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Author comes laſt, and, like a Man a Drowning, he catches at ſome, or all of theſe, but holds by none. They are too ſlippery, and fly from him; it muſt be part of the one, and part of t'other, that will ſerve this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; and therefore he does wiſely not to pitch upon any one. But yet without pitching upon ſome one, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all other, ſticking cloſe by it, he can never demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Truth, nor ſpeak conſiſtently with himſelf. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we muſt follow him as he pleaſes to lead us, though he fights in Clouds of Duſt, that it is not eaſy to find him out.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen his Principles as to <hi>Government,</hi> which he hides in Generals. But it is plain they are <hi>Antii-monarchical,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59238:16"/>though we cannot tell exactly the Glaſs to which they belong.</p>
            <p>But what proof he offers for them is in his <hi>Introduction,</hi> wherein he pretends to prove, <hi>That a King who deſigns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a People, Abdicates the Government of them.</hi> Thence c. 2. and 3. his buſineſs is to ſhew, That King <hi>James</hi> had that Deſign. <hi>Ergo</hi>—</p>
            <p>But c. 1. he goes a little aſide, and undertakes this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>viz. That it is Lawful for one Prince to interpoſe between another Prince and his Subjects,<note place="margin">The Caſe of one Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt another Prince and his Subjects.</note> when he uſes them Cruelly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not meddle with this Chapter, for two Reaſons. Firſt, It is undertaken by another hand. Secondly, My bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is with the Duty of Subjects, in which only they are Concern'd for whoſe benefit I write.</p>
            <p>But I will give you this General Notion of it. That by the Arguments he advances, it is Lawful not only for <hi>every Prince,</hi> but for <hi>every Neighbour</hi> to inſpect into his Neighbour's Family, and to diſpoſſeſs him of his <hi>Houſe,</hi> of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> of his <hi>Tenants, Servants, Children,</hi> of his <hi>Wife,</hi> when he uſes them Cruelly. And this Charitable Interpoſer ſhall ſeize upon them all for himſelf, on pretence of uſing them better.</p>
            <p>He gives Examples of ſeveral Princes, who have thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed 'twixt their Neighbour Kings and their Subjects, and ſo he might many more; the World is full of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and of many other Examples, which perhaps this Another won'd be a ſham'd to juſtify.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that good Kings (who have been ſo reputed) have done this? What then? May not good Men have their Failings? I do not think that <hi>David</hi>'s Deciſion 'twixt <hi>Ziba</hi> and <hi>Miphihoſheth,</hi> would be a good Rule for future Juſtice. Though our Author has not truly repreſented all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that he produces, which will be ſhewn. But if they were true, it is no Angument.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only mind our Author of his own Words, which I will have occaſion to mention hereafter; <hi>viz. That it is a moſt Unlawful Thing for any to call in a Foreign Force, or erect a new Government to Redneſs unjuſt Laws</hi>— And again, <hi>That it is Intolerable for the Members of any State, to flee to Foreign
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59238:16"/>Succors out of Pretence, that their own Governours have made Laws againſt Reaſon, Conſcience, and Juſtice, and Fooliſh to alledge in their defence, That all Mankind is of one Blood, and bound to help one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leave our Author to Recant this, or Reconcile it, at his Leaſure to this firſt Chapter of his Book. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not expreſly Undertake. I will paſs for this time, and return to his Principles of Subjection to Government, which is my preſent Task.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Author's defence of his Principles.</note>Let us now come to examine the Defence he makes for theſe his Principles.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We will conſider his <hi>Arguments.</hi> Secondly, His <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> and <hi>Authorities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Point he is to prove, we will take in his own Words, n. 1. of the Introduction, <hi>viz. That a King who deſigns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his People, Abdicates the Government of them.</hi> And here as to his <hi>Reaſons,</hi> or <hi>Arguments</hi> to prove this,<note place="margin">From Reaſon.</note> he diſappoints us. For his whole Introduction (wherein he undertakes the Proof of this) is nothing but <hi>Quotations,</hi> which we are to examine by themſelves. But he tells us not his own Opinion, you ſhall not faſten upon him.</p>
            <p>He begins. <hi>It is granted by ſome</hi>— and I might anſwer, <hi>What is not granted by ſome?</hi> He is afraid at his firſt ſetting out. N. 1. he has one Quotation out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> and another out of <hi>Hammord.</hi> N. 2. one out of Dr. <hi>Hicks,</hi> and another out of <hi>Faulkner.</hi> N. 3. he Quotes the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> again. And then, N. 4. (which is the laſt) concludes from their Authorities. All which is to be conſider'd, when we come to the ſecond Claſs I have deſign'd to ſpeak to, that is, his <hi>Quotations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for his <hi>Reaſons</hi> he puts us to the pains to gather them by an innuendo, <hi>viz.</hi> That what he Quotes out of others is his own Opinion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, laying aſide his <hi>Authorities</hi> to their proper Place, we will examine the <hi>Reaſons</hi> which are produc'd.</p>
            <p>Thus then he ſets forth. <hi>It is granted by ſome of the higheſt Aſſertors of Paſſive Obedience, that if a King deſign to root out a People, or deſtroy one main part of his Subjects in favour of another whom, he loves better, that they may prevent it even by oppoſing him with force; and that he is to be judg'd in ſuch a caſe to have</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59238:17"/>Abdicated <hi>the Government of thoſe whom he deſigns to deſtroy, contrary to Juſtice and the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he does not offer to prove. I ſuppoſe he thinks it ſelf-evident. Therefore we will examine it very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Firſt Reaſon, of a King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his <hi>whole</hi> People.</note>There are three Things to be conſider'd in it. Firſt, a King deſigning to root out a People, that is, the <hi>whole People;</hi> to deſtroy <hi>all the whole Nation</hi> whom he Governs. Secondly, his deſign to deſtroy <hi>a part only</hi> of his People. And Thirdly, the point of <hi>Abdication,</hi> in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt. <hi>Grotius,</hi> as Quoted by our Author, ſays, that it cannot enter into the heart of a King, who is not <hi>mad;</hi> for that would be to deſtroy himſelf. And Hiſtory affords no Example of this ſort, ſince the World began. None of theſe quoted by this Author, p. 13 do reach this Caſe at all. Neither <hi>Nero, Caligula, Domitian,</hi> nor <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> deſign'd to deſtroy their <hi>whole People;</hi> though this Author in that Section would fain inſinuate it. But it cannot paſs upon any who are in their Senſes; ſome in a <hi>Huffing fit</hi> might wiſh, That all the World had but one Neck, that they might ſtrike it off at a blow: Hence our Author would preſently conclude as he does, c. 2. ſ. 1. n. 3. <hi>That a Prince may deſign to deſtroy his Subjects, i. e. all</hi> his Subjects; He might as well draw an Argument from all the vaporing Stuff of <hi>Almanzor.</hi> And if our Author will inſiſt upon this, every ſober Man will think him as <hi>mad,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> thought that King who ſhould attempt any ſuch Thing. What hands ſhould the King imploy to deſtroy all his Subjects? But I will give over this point, leaſt I too ſhould be thought mad to labour ſuch a Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Seond Reaſon, of a King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a <hi>paert</hi> of his People.</note>The Second Point is, The King's deſign to deſtroy <hi>a part only</hi> of his People.</p>
            <p>And the Queſtion naturally riſes, <hi>What part?</hi> Every Man is a <hi>part</hi> of the People. And there is abſolute neceſſity to have this determin'd, otherwiſe no Government can poſſibly ſubſiſt. For if all People, who think themſelves oppreſs'd under any Government, have Liberty to riſe in Arms againſt the Government, there would be little Peace in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59238:17"/>Again: If the deſign of a Government to deſtroy a Man does diſſolve their Authority over that Man, then it would follow, that Men condemn'd to <hi>dye,</hi> or <hi>out law'd,</hi> though for <hi>Rebellion,</hi> were no longer Subjects, nor ow'd any Duty or Allegiance to the Government, which is contrary to the general Senſe of Mankind, and I ſuppoſe our Author will not have the Confidence to aſſert; yet it follows unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly from his Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Third Reaſon, <hi>Invading</hi> of <hi>Property.</hi>
               </note>But will nothing leſs than a Deſign to take my <hi>Life</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Government? Yes; <hi>Invading</hi> my <hi>Property,</hi> or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me the leaſt Injury, by this Author's Principles, does diſſolve the Government, and ſet me at Liberty to take Arms againſt them: For he that does me a <hi>ſmall</hi> Injury may doe a <hi>greater,</hi> and he that takes my <hi>Goods</hi> may take my <hi>Life</hi> too, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus c. 3. ſ. 8. n. 2. p. 97. this Author lays it down as a Principle, That where the Government ruins the <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Subject, that Government <hi>diſſolves it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we muſt ask (as in the former Caſe of deſtroying a part of the People) How much Ruine of Property is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſſolve the Government? And he ſeems to anſwer it by putting in the word <hi>Intirely, viz.</hi> where a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Intirely</hi> ruins the <hi>Property</hi> of the Subject.</p>
            <p>But he will not ſtick to this: That word was put in only to amuſe; for the Property of Subjects can never be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely</hi> ruined, while one Man has a Groat in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>May be he will ſay, That though they have it in their <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> yet they have no <hi>Property</hi> to it, if there be a <hi>Power</hi> in the <hi>Government</hi> to take it from them. But this will doe him as little Service; for at this rate no Subject in the World has, or can have, any Property; becauſe in all Conſtitutions of Government, there muſt be a Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power lodged in ſome hands or other; which is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arbitrary in all the <hi>Species</hi> of Government; and all have power of Levying Money from off their Subjects.</p>
            <p>Here ſome may fanſie to make a Diſtinction, That in <hi>Free States,</hi> as we call them, the Subjects who conſent to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59238:18"/>the <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> do thereby conſent to their Raiſing of Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the <hi>People</hi> be the <hi>Original</hi> of all Government, their Conſent to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> is as much implied in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I ſuppoſe our Author's meaning muſt not be as to the <hi>Power</hi> of the Government, (which, as I ſaid, is <hi>Equal</hi> in all Governments,) but as to the <hi>Adminiſtration; viz.</hi> If the Government ſhould take my Goods wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, or ſhould lay Deſigns to take them from me. And in this caſe, if they take but a <hi>Penny,</hi> the Deſign may be carried as to all, and then the Government is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the word <hi>Intirely,</hi> which our Author put in, ſignifies juſt nothing at all, in his way of improving the leaſt Injury to infer the greateſt.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew you that this is his meaning in this ſame Section, n. 8. p. 74. he aſſerts, That the Governments ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the <hi>Charter</hi> of <hi>Derry</hi> unjuſtly, as he ſays, was a ſufficient Ground for them to take Arms againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which he calls, <hi>Doing themſelves Juſtice.</hi> But you may think that there was ſomething elſe in the Caſe, beſides the buſineſs of the Charter. No, he ſays, <hi>If there had been no other temptation but this, they were not to be blamed, to withdraw themſelves from a Government they durſt not truſt.</hi> And he gives the ſame Reaſon I have told above, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving every thing to the utmoſt: For, ſays he, <hi>They concluded that a Government that could take away their Charter, their Priviledges, might as eaſily and unavoidably find another nicety to take away what remained, together with their Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fourth Reaſon, <hi>Diſarming</hi> a part of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note>But farther, not only meddling with our <hi>Property</hi> ſhall be Pretence enough to diſſolve the Government; but if the Government ſhould offer to <hi>diſarm</hi> thoſe whom they knew, and this Author confeſſes, to be their mortal Enemies, the Caſe of my Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> diſarming the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there, who, after all their diſarming, this Author confeſſes, p. 111. <hi>had Arms enough to make the Papiſts affraid, and to beat
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59238:18"/>them too.</hi> And the Generality of the Proteſtants in that Kingdom, who were out of the reach of the Government, were then actually in Arms againſt the Government; yet <hi>diſarming</hi> ſuch of theſe, as the Government could come at, this Author proves by his uſual <hi>Climax</hi> to be a Deſign even of <hi>Maſſacre. For had they not reaſon,</hi> ſays he, p. 115. <hi>to believe that they were diſarm'd purpoſely that they might be the more eaſily Robb'd or Maſſacred?</hi> And, p. 112. he calls that Diſarming, <hi>perfect Dragooning, terrible Dragooning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider what a Scheme of Government this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has given us, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Government have a <hi>Deſign</hi> againſt our <hi>Lives,</hi> the Government is diſſolv'd. And if they take a <hi>Peny</hi> from us, or ſo much as diſpute the <hi>Charter</hi> of any Town, or preſume but to <hi>Diſarm</hi> any of their Subjects, though they be actually in Arms againſt them, this ſhall be improv'd into a Deſign of <hi>Maſſacre;</hi> and then we owe no more Obedience to the Government: It is diſſolv'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Author's Rule of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> conſider'd.</note>I come now to the Third Point, that is, of <hi>Abdication;</hi> and the only true Notion of it, by all <hi>Civilians,</hi> is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A King's Voluntary Reſignation of the Crown to the next Heir.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But take it in that Senſe which by ſome of late has been put upon it, and it will by no means help this Author's Cauſe: For I ſuppoſe none, even of them, will allow that it is left to every private Perſon to determine what ſort of Withdrawing himſelf ſhall be judged an <hi>Abdication</hi> in the King, ſo as to Diſſolve the Government, and Abſolve the Subjects from their Allegiance.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt fled to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to ſave his Life from thoſe who pretended to make him <hi>A GLORIOUS KING.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second withdrew himſelf into <hi>foreign</hi> Countries for ſeveral Years; yet neither of them was ever ſaid to have <hi>Abdicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was debated ſtrongly in the <hi>Convention,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>James</hi> the Second's <hi>Withdrawing</hi> was an <hi>Abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> or not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59238:19"/>This ſhews that they thought the Deciſion of ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Aſſembly</hi> neceſſary to ſettle that Point; and that it was not leſt to every Man to decide ſo great a Matter, whereon the Safety of the Nation does depend.</p>
            <p>Therefore this Author's juſtifying what his <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> did upon the Account of King <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Abdication,</hi> will do them no Service, upon that Notion of <hi>Abdication,</hi> ſet up by the <hi>Convention</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> becauſe they were up in Arms againſt King <hi>James</hi> before the <hi>Convention</hi> in <hi>England</hi> declared him to have <hi>Abdicated,</hi> and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Withdrawing himſelf;</hi> upon which they pretended to ground their <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Abdication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Author muſt not ſtay for that. He gives every Man <hi>Authority</hi> to paſs <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Deprivation</hi> againſt his <hi>Sovereign</hi> when he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>C. 1. n. 8. p 10. he ſays, <hi>By endeavouring to deſtroy us, he</hi> (the King) <hi>in that very Act abdicated the Government</hi>— <hi>and therefore in all Equity we are abſolved from Oaths made to him as Governor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In that very Act!</hi> Nay, even his <hi>Deſign,</hi> as you have heard, to take a <hi>Peny</hi> from us, or to bring a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt a <hi>Charter,</hi> that is, to take the Benefit of the Law againſt any of his Subjects, in a Legal manner, ſhall be a Diſſolution of the Government, and <hi>Abſolution</hi> from our Oaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Fifth Reaſon as to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving Oaths of Allegianee.</note>Here is very good Learning as to the Nature of Oaths, and Arguments moſt convincing: He goes on in the ſame Section, n. 10. p. 11. <hi>That King</hi> James <hi>conſenting to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the Oath of Supremacy in</hi> Ireland, <hi>proved either that be deſigned to Releaſe us from the Peculiar Obligation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from them (our Oaths of Allegiance) as too ſtrict, or elſe that he did not deſign to depend on our Oaths for our Loyalty,</hi> (whoever does will be miſtaken, you have given demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) <hi>and therefore laid them aſide as of no force to oblige us; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which muſt proceed from an Intention to deſtroy the Ancient Government with which he was entruſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us ſuppoſe, with this Author, That King <hi>James</hi> (having ſeen and experimented the little Security Oaths were to Government, againſt the Byaſs of <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi>) were willing to remove ſuch a <hi>Stumbling-block</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi> and that Men ſhould Swear <hi>no more:</hi> would
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59238:19"/>this abſolve the Oaths that were taken <hi>before?</hi> Again, moſt know the Objection which the Papiſts have againſt our Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, <hi>viz.</hi> That it depreſſes the Pope's Power <hi>in Spirituals.</hi> Now becauſe K. <hi>James</hi> Repeals this, our Author would infer, That he meant to Releaſe the Proteſtants from their Allegiance to himſelf in <hi>Temporals.</hi> Does this Author think, That K. <hi>James</hi> Repeal'd this Oath becauſe it was too full of <hi>Loyalty?</hi> or becauſe there was ſomething elſe in it, which K. <hi>James</hi> thought was againſt the Tenets of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> I am aſham'd to ask the Queſtion, none are ignorant of the Reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>Our Author will find this Argument of his Verbatim al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the Writings of the <hi>Cameronian Presbyterians.</hi> (I know not if he had it from them, but at leaſt he ſees how near he is come to them; for when Men jump in the ſame Principles, it is likely they will find out the ſame Arguments.) Theſe <hi>Cameronians</hi> do prove, That K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. conſenting to Repeal the <hi>Covenant</hi> did thereby <hi>Remit the Subjects Allegiance, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the Bond of it.</hi> Vid. <hi>The Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence,</hi> Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1692. p. 49.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Covenant</hi> was Eſtabliſhed by Act of their <hi>Parliament</hi> as well as <hi>General Aſſembly;</hi> and K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. conſented to it, and took it, and ſwore by his Coronation Oath in <hi>Scotland</hi> to maintain it; and it ſwore Faith and Allegiance to him; and therefore this Author would do well to think of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity 'twixt his Argument and that of the <hi>Cameronians;</hi> 'twixt K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. conſenting to Repeal the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and K. <hi>James</hi> II. conſenting to Repeal the Oath of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> Each Oath was to Eſtabliſh a <hi>Supremacy</hi> over the <hi>Church,</hi> the one a <hi>Lay-Regal,</hi> the other a <hi>Lay-Elder,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy. And the one King might think the one as faulty, as the other thought the other. But that either of theſe Kings meant to weaken the Allegiance of his Subjects, by taking away theſe Oaths, the one is as true as the other.</p>
            <p>Our Author has one Argument more, why this Allegiance to K. <hi>James</hi> did ceaſe; <hi>He</hi> (K. <hi>James</hi>) <hi>having left none</hi> (no Oath of Allegiance) <hi>that we know of in this Kingdom, which any Law obliges us to take.</hi> And what then? Is there no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance due, where there is no Oath? Our Allegiance is due, by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> prior to the King's Oath to us,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59238:20"/>or our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to him. Oaths in that Caſe do not create the Duty; they are only in Confirmation of what was our Duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>In the Eaſtern Monarchies they do not uſe Coronation Oaths, nor Oaths of Allegiance. And <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was ſo wiſe (ſays <hi>the Unreaſonableneſs of a new Separation on account of the Oaths,</hi> p. 40.) as when they offered him their Oaths, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them for this Reaſon,<note place="margin">Dio. l. 54.</note> 
               <hi>He conſider'd well,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dio, that if they gave their free Conſent, they would do what they promiſed without Swearing; and if they did not, all the Oaths in the World would not make them.</hi> Did <hi>Auguſtus</hi> for this expect no Allegiance from his Subjects? Or are not the Eaſtern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs pretty Abſolute, becauſe the Law in thoſe Nations does not require <hi>Oaths?</hi> But after all, by the <hi>Common Law</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> all above 16 are to ſwear Allegiance to the King, and it may be exacted from them in their <hi>Leets.</hi> And this is the Reaſon they gave for impoſing the new Oaths in <hi>Ireland</hi> to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was an Act of Parliament for it. And therefore there was as much Law of the Land for ſwearing of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to K. <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> after his Repeal of the Oath of Supremacy, as our Author can pretend there was for ſwearing to K. <hi>William</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> before the new Act impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Oaths there. So that our Author is out too in matter of Law.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Sixth Reaſon, in anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>Who ſhall be Judge?</hi>
               </note>But the main of the Difficulty is yet behind; and that is, That upon our Author's Scheme of diſſolving Oaths and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for ſuch Reaſons as he thinks fit, he has not told us <hi>who ſhall be Judge</hi> of theſe Forfeitures, or Abdications. This I have urg'd already, but you have not heard our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's anſwer. He ſays, c. 2. ſ. 1. n. 2. p. 12. it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Objected, <hi>Who ſhall be Judge?</hi> and he reſolves it thus. <hi>That either the People muſt be left to judge of the Deſigns of their Governors</hi>— <hi>Or elſe they muſt be oblig'd to a blind and abſolute Submiſſion, without imploying their Underſtanding in the Caſe.</hi> Thus our Author like a mighty Man! Yet this Sophiſm is as poor a one as the laſt about the Oaths. For in the Caſe we are upon of determining a Cauſe, 'twixt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the Subjects, when we ſay, <hi>who ſhall be Judge?</hi> The meaning is not, who ſhall have Power to think in his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59238:20"/>own Mind? We ſay, <hi>Thoughts are free.</hi> And this ſort of <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Judgment,</hi> or of being a <hi>Judge,</hi> can no more be taken from any Man than his Power of <hi>Thinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when there is a Conteſt 'twixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People</hi> (which is the Caſe we are upon) the Queſtion, <hi>who ſhall be Judge?</hi> is, <hi>who has Authority to determine the Cauſe betwixt them?</hi> as a <hi>Judge</hi> does between two contending Parties. In which Senſe, none can be a <hi>Judge</hi> but he that has a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from ſome who has Power to inveſt him with that <hi>Authority, viz.</hi> to judge 'twixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People;</hi> which none can have but God alone. And to ſay, that every Man who is not ſuch a <hi>Judge</hi> as this has not leave to <hi>imploy his Underſtanding in the Caſe,</hi> becauſe he has not Power <hi>Authoritatively</hi> to determine the Caſe, ſo as to oblige, and tye up the contending Parties, is what this Author would ſlily paſs upon you undiſcover'd, but it is too plain to bear an Argument.</p>
            <p>Well then. The Queſtion is concerning an <hi>Authoritative</hi> Judge, and our Author proceeds. <hi>I dare appeal,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to all the World, whether it be ſafer to leave it to the Judgment and Conſciences of a whole Kingdom to determine concerning the Deſigns of their Governor, or to leave it to the Will and Conſcience of the King, whether he will deſtroy them. One of theſe is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and I am aſſured it is leſs probable, that the Generality of a Kingdom will concur in a Miſtake of this Nature, and leſs miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, if they ſhould miſtake, than that a King by Weakneſs, wicked Councellors, or falſe Principles, ſhould deſign to make his People Slaves, ſubvert the Antient Government, or deſtroy one part of his People, whom he hates, in favour of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Author. And the Caſe is plauſibly laid down, and no doubt would gain the <hi>Cry</hi> at an <hi>Election.</hi> But there is another Proſpect of this Caſe, which our Author takes care to conceal; and that is, What if a Cunning and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning <hi>Incendiary</hi> makes a <hi>Party,</hi> and prevails Univerſally among the People, and perſwades them to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction? <hi>Miſrepreſent</hi> their <hi>Governor,</hi> and Impoſe upon them, That a <hi>Civil War</hi> is better, and by this means get them to Deſtroy and Conſume one another?</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Abſalom,</hi> thus did <hi>Sheba,</hi> thus <hi>Oliver,</hi> and all the <hi>proſperons Rebels.</hi> There is no other way of moving the People, unleſs you could bring them all to a fair Vote, which is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59238:21"/>
               <hi>only Impoſſible,</hi> at leaſt it was never done, and therefore we juſtly may ſuppoſe it never will be. Let us leave theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings in the Clouds, and bring this Author to <hi>matter of Fact.</hi> Are not all <hi>Revolutions</hi> carried on by <hi>making Parties, Combinations</hi> of <hi>Leading-men, Aſperſing</hi> your <hi>Oppoſites,</hi> uſing all Arts to Byaſs the <hi>Mob</hi> to your ſide?

Did they leave it <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>impartially</hi> to the Judgment of the <hi>People,</hi> without any <hi>Miſrepreſentations,</hi> or <hi>invidious Inſinuations?</hi> And was it Equal to them, whether the People, upon a fair Hearing, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd againſt them as <hi>Rebels,</hi> or for them as <hi>Patriots?</hi> Can there be a Method for the People to have ſuch a fair Hearing of the Cauſe, and to determine it <hi>Judicially?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Author cannot ſay that any of theſe Things has been, or are ever likely to be done, he muſt acknowledge, That there is infinitely more hazzard of Giddy Peoples being <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd</hi> by Inſinuating Crafty Men, who ſeek their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in it, to entertain <hi>Jealouſies</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's Deſigns, and to <hi>over-rate</hi> every Hardſhip and ill Uſage they receive from him; than that a King ſhould deſign to deſtroy his People, which would be to deſtroy himſelf. And if <hi>one of theſe is Unavoidable,</hi> as our Author ſays, It is eaſy to ſee where the moſt danger lyes. The one has been our own Caſe, and is almoſt every day. The other is Imaginary, without an Inſtance in the World, in the Extremity our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor puts it; and, at the worſt, many degrees preferable to a <hi>Civil War,</hi> as will be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>Nor will the <hi>Number</hi> of the People, or <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of their Leaders excuſe any thing, It makes their Rebellion more <hi>Fatal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 16.12.</note> In the Rebellion of <hi>Korah</hi> there were 250 <hi>Princes of the Aſſembly, famous in the Congregation, Men of Renown.</hi> And, <hi>All the Children of Iſrael— The whole Congregation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 14. v. 24.</note> mutiny'd againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and were chuſing another Captain, and returning into <hi>Egypt.</hi> And <hi>Korah</hi> gather'd <hi>all the Congregation againſt them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 16. v. 19, 41, 49.</note> 
               <hi>and on the morrow all the Congregation</hi>— murmured againſt 'em. For which God deſtroy'd 14700 by a new Plague.</p>
            <p>Now judge with your ſelf if ſuch a Governor as <hi>Moſes</hi> could not ſecure himſelf from the Power which <hi>Ten</hi> Leading Men had with the People (for they were no more who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59238:21"/>caus'd this Mutiny of the <hi>whole Congregation, Num.</hi> 14.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>viz. Ten</hi> of the <hi>Twelve</hi> Searchers of the Land) what Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's <hi>Virtue, Sufficiency,</hi> or <hi>Diligence,</hi> can ſecure him? We know how <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſtole the Hearts of the People from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his Father. And they follow'd him <hi>in the ſimplicity of their Hearts,</hi> ſays the Text; as many did, at firſt, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr. But I cannot tell if our Author will allow that for an Inſtance, I know not how far his new Principles have carried him. It is hard to ſtop in ſuch a Courſe. Their Repentance is Rare; eſpecially of thoſe who are Converted to it from contrary Principles. And if there be a viſible Motive of Intereſt, it makes their Return ſtill more difficult.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this Point in our Author's Phraſe. <hi>I dare appeal to all the World,</hi> whether it be more dangerous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt the King from the Judgment of the People, or to put it in the Power of any Diſcontented or Ambitious Men to endeavour to <hi>diſguſt</hi> the People againſt the Government, and lead them into a <hi>Civil War</hi> at their Pleaſure? For that is the true ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>We know how many <hi>Mahomet</hi> has perſwaded. And by what means <hi>Falſe Religions,</hi> and <hi>Seditious Principles,</hi> have ſpread through the World. No doubt, this Author intended his Book ſhould take among the People. He knew People could be Impos'd upon; and never ſo much as when they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jol'd, and told fine Stories of their <hi>Power,</hi> Paramount to all Kings and Governors.</p>
            <p>That it is in their hands to pull down one, and ſet up another, to bind their Kings in Chains, and root up all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments at their Pleaſure, for this Argument of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's militates equally againſt <hi>all Sorts</hi> of <hi>Government.</hi> And he may appeal again to all the World,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Queſtion,</hi> Who ſhall be Judge? <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, <hi>and</hi> States.</note> Whether it be ſafer to leave it to the Judgments and Conſciences of a whole Nation to determine concerning the Deſigns of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors (whether <hi>Parliaments</hi> or <hi>States</hi>) or to leave it to the Will and Conſcience of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> whether they will deſtroy them? And one of theſe is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, It is not likely that a <hi>Parliament</hi> or <hi>States</hi> ſhould deſign to deſtroy the People. That is another Queſtion.</p>

               <note place="margin">Compar'd with <hi>Kings.</hi>
               </note>But pray tell me, Would any <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> of <hi>States,</hi> looſe ſo much by the Deſtruction of the Kingdom, as the <hi>King?</hi> Therefore it is leſs probable that <hi>he</hi> ſhould <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> its Deſtruction, than <hi>any</hi> of <hi>them.</hi> There may be an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi> given to any of them to Betray and Ruin his Country, and there are Examples of it in all Ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jugurtha</hi> Brib'd the whole <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> even when he was at War with them.</p>
            <p>About 20 Years ago, the <hi>French Faction</hi> among the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> were able to <hi>Out-vote</hi> the other. And ſome believe it is ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p>How has the allarm of <hi>French Pentioners</hi> diſturb'd our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments? But more that of <hi>Court Pentioners.</hi> Who are Free to give our Money (the ſooner we ſhall have done) but Deaf to <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Miſcarriages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was there ever a <hi>Parliament, Convention,</hi> or <hi>Senate,</hi> where the major Number was <hi>Un bribable?</hi> Or was there ever a Bribe offer'd to a King to Betray or Sell his Country? <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd</hi> he may be, or <hi>take wrong Meaſures;</hi> but it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavable he ſhou'd <hi>Deſign</hi> the Ruin of his Country.</p>
            <p>Therefore whoever you make Judg of the <hi>King</hi>'s Deſigns, muſt, from a ſtronger Reaſon, be Judg of the Deſigns of <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>States:</hi> And this will unhinge all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World.</p>
            <p>But our Author endeavours to ſmooth all this by ſaying in the beginning of this Section,<note place="margin">Of Fears and Jealouſies.</note> n. 1. p. 12. <hi>That</hi> Fears <hi>and</hi> Jealouſies, <hi>in ſuch a Caſe, ought not to paſs for</hi> Arguments, <hi>or be brought in Competition with a</hi> certain <hi>and</hi> plain Duty, <hi>that is, with</hi> Obedience <hi>to</hi> Lawful Governors. <hi>The Arguments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore brought by Subjects to prove their Governors deſign to deſtroy them, ought to be ſo</hi> plain <hi>and</hi> evident, <hi>that the Conſciences of Mankind</hi> cannot <hi>but ſee, and be convinc'd of their Truth; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Generality of the Subjects themſelves ought to be</hi> fully <hi>ſatisfied, and</hi> acquieſce <hi>in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all theſe fine Words leave us juſt where we were. For every Man is Judge ſtill; and he is Judge when he himſelf is <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and will <hi>acquieſce</hi> in the Arguments brought againſt his Governor.</p>
            <p>And Men that are Deceived do think themſelves in the Right, elſe they were not Deceived. So that the Rule of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59238:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>Government is ſtill left Looſe and Precarious; as Uncertain as the Giddy Motions of the <hi>Mob,</hi> And laid open to all the Attempts of Ambitious and Deſigning Men.</p>
            <p>Our Author ſays, <hi>That Jealouſies and Fears, in ſuch a Caſe, ought not to paſs for Arguments.</hi> This needs ſome Explanation. For what more can there be of a Governor's Deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us (which is the Caſe in hand) beſides a <hi>Jealouſy</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> of it? Till the Action be done, we cannot be ſure of it; not ſo ſure as our Author requires, <hi>viz.</hi> we can have no ſuch Security, <hi>that ought to be brought in Competition with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and plain Duty, that is, with Obedience to Lawful Governors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is hardly an Action in the World, but may be done out of ſeveral Deſigns; and none ſo much as the Actions of <hi>Governors,</hi> and <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> And therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo eaſy as to be Miſtaken in theſe Deſigns. Eſpecially if theſe Deſigns be kept as Secrets of State among Princes themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>French</hi> League.</note>Such was the ſuppos'd League which K. <hi>James</hi> was ſaid to have made with K. <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to Root out all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, not only of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but <hi>all the World over.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was ſo Induſtriouſly ſpread abroad, and vouched with ſuch Confidence, that it was given out the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> had procur'd the Original ſign'd by both Kings, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in Parliament.</p>
            <p>This was believ'd, and clamour'd about by Multitudes of ſilly People.</p>
            <p>But neither the <hi>Prince</hi> in his <hi>Declaration,</hi> nor the <hi>Convention</hi> in their Liſt of Male-adminiſtrations againſt K. <hi>James</hi> did mention the leaſt tittle of this; which would have ſerved more to their purpoſe than all the reſt they had to allege.</p>
            <p>And the might have added, that Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> in his Letter (n. 15. Append. quoted in this Author's Book, p 145.) proteſts <hi>he never knew of any; and that</hi> French <hi>Ships were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to join with our Fleet, and they were refuſed.</hi>

            <p>Nor has it been heard of ſince from the mouth of any who pretend to common ſenſe, or the leaſt knowledg of Affairs, till we were Rattl'd with it out of the Pulpit in this Authors Thankſgiving Sermon before the Lords Juſtices of <hi>Ireland, Nov.</hi> 16. 1690.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But he knows better Things, he underſtands all their <hi>Cabals.</hi> He tells (page 5. 9. 16. of the Sermon) <hi>How</hi> England, Holland, <hi>the</hi> Pope, <hi>and the</hi> Emperor, <hi>might be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd and wheedled.

            </p>
            <p>There's a Plot for you!</p>
            <p>And p. 10. he asks K. <hi>James, What buſineſs had he with an Army?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leaving his <hi>Politicks,</hi> let us come with him a little to the Argument.</p>
            <p>He has Eſtabliſhed it before, That <hi>Jealouſies and Fears</hi> are not to paſs for Arguments <hi>againſt the certain and plain Duty of Obedience to Lawful Governors.</hi> But that what is brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ought to be <hi>ſo Plain and Evident that the Conſciences of Mankind cannot but ſee and be convinc'd of its Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet he brings here againſt K. <hi>James</hi> ſuch Traſh as <hi>Grub-ſtreet</hi> would be aſham'd to own; and, if the Sermon were not ſo common, I ſhould be afraid to Quote, leaſt it ſhould be thought an Impoſition upon this Author. But he has ſet his Name to it, and Dedicated it to the <hi>Lords Juſtices</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> before whom he Preach'd it.</p>
            <p>Of all the Inſtances above-nam'd, we are more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd in that of the Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pr. of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </note> againſt whom he gives no other proof but p. 5 of his Sermon, where he ſays, <hi>We are ſatisfied, i.e.</hi> of his being a Cheat.</p>
            <p>If theſe Gentlemen (for whom, and in whoſe Name, this Author here ſpeaks) had been ſo Good, or this Author for them, to have told us what Evidence they had to ſatisfie themſelves in a Point ſo Important as this?</p>
            <p>Now when all the ſenſible Men of <hi>England</hi> are fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was truly born of the Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59238:23"/>When it is no longer made a doubt of, nor endur'd to be mention'd at <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> The but Queſtioning of it <hi>is a ſtob at the heart of this Prince,</hi> (ſays <hi>the Hiſtory of the Deſert.</hi> p. 107.) you need not ask which <hi>Prince</hi> it is who does not love to hear of it? And who they are who preſs it to be heard and examin'd? For which I refer you to n. 16. Append.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe well known, that this was but the tail of an old Plot, to ſay the ſame of any Son the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhould ever have, of which n. 17. Appendix contains a Proof ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: And ſhews the indefatigable Pains of that <hi>Phanatick, Republican, Hogan Mogan</hi> Party, to render the <hi>Bill of Excluſion</hi> effectually ſervicable to the End for which it was intended.</p>
            <p>This was thought to have been handſomly cover'd, when <hi>Zuyleſtein</hi> was ſent over to congratulate the Birth of the P. of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, he was publickly Prayed for as P. of <hi>Wales</hi> in her <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> Chappel at the <hi>Hague,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did often Officiate.</p>
            <p>To ſay that they did not believe him to be P. of <hi>Wales</hi> at that time, is to accuſe them of ſuch Atheiſtical Hypocriſy, making a mock of God in his ſolemn Worſhip, as would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them an abhorring to all Fleſh.</p>
            <p>To avoid this terrible Charge, you will be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That their <hi>Highneſſes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> too, did not <hi>then</hi> believe the Reports of the Queens Falſe-Belly; for they were ſpread abroad long before.</p>
            <p>And what Evidence they have got ſince, beſides theſe ſame Reports, is what the Nation wants to know, but are not like to be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nihil Dicit</hi> is confeſſing of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Yet our Author ſays that he, and the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> of his Party, are all ſatisfied (for thoſe I ſuppoſe he means by the <hi>We all</hi> are ſatisfied) of the Impoſture of the P. of <hi>Wales.</hi> And, by his Principles here laid down, their Proofs muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Jealouſies and Fears,</hi> and be <hi>ſo plain and evident as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Mankind cannot but ſee, and be convinced of their Truth.</hi> And then why ſhould not he Produce them?</p>
            <p>If he ſays, as I ſuppoſe he muſt, that he once thought it was <hi>Evident.</hi> So it was for ſome time thought by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the People of <hi>England,</hi> that the 3500 <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59238:24"/>were disbanded by K. <hi>James</hi> before he went away, were about to Maſſacre all <hi>England,</hi> and had actually begun the Work, and the whole Nation was terribly allarm'd.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ſo Ridiculous may not be put upon ſome People as <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Evident</hi> in ſome Junctures.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Earl of <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
               </note>That the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was aſſaſſinated went down greedily with ſome ſort of People, for a while; though People of ſenſe did not then believe it, nor his Lady, as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to many noble Relations of his Lordſhip, and her own.</p>
            <p>But now the Trick is all come out, and how that whole matter was managed. Mr. <hi>Hook,</hi> then Chaplain to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and who came over with him from <hi>Holland,</hi> wrote a Narrative of it at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> as himſelf declared, for a Preparatory to their Undertaking. Another was wrote by Col. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and another at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and was taken in Col. <hi>Danvers</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>London.</hi> And they bragg'd how much Service it did in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſtirr'd up the People againſt K. <hi>James,</hi> and to join with the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Committee of Lords was appointed ſince this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Rake into that matter again; but after long Sitting, and Examinations, could make nothing of it, and were forced to let it fall, I ſuppoſe now for ever.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Richard Haddock,</hi> at preſent firſt Commiſſioner of the Navy, declared before the ſaid Committee, That he ſaw the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> lying in his Blood, and having conſidered the narrowneſs of the Place where he lay, and all other Circumſtances, he could not have been ſo Murther'd by any but himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Braddon</hi>'s Tryal it ſelf is enough to Detect it to any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Reader.</p>
            <p>But that this Author may not be accus'd for proving of nothing that he ſays, he has undertaken to make out the <hi>Grand League</hi> before told; in the aforeſaid Sermon, from a Letter of Biſhop <hi>Maloony</hi>'s to Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has printed in the Appendix of his Book.</p>
            <p>There, Page 363. Biſhop <hi>Maloony</hi> is inveighing againſt K. <hi>James</hi>'s Politicks, in truſting too much to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſeeking to pleaſe them, while he rejected the aſſiſtance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59238:24"/>which the <hi>French King</hi> offered him. <hi>If the King of</hi> France, ſays that Biſhop, <hi>had not been too Generous, and too Chriſtian a Prince, were it not a ſufficient Motive for him to Reject the King in his Diſgrace, that upon thoſe rotten Principles Rejected his Alliance. This is that Alliance with</hi> France (ſays our Author in his aboveſaid Sermon, p. 5.) <hi>which</hi> Maloony, <hi>the Popiſh Biſhop of</hi> Killa loo, <hi>in a Letter of his to Biſhop</hi> Tyrrel, <hi>is ſo very angry that ſome Trimmers</hi> (as he calleth them) <hi>oblig'd King</hi> James <hi>to diſown.</hi> Theſe <hi>Trimmers</hi> were the aboveſaid <hi>rotten Principles,</hi> as that Biſhop calls them, of truſting to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And theſe oblig'd King <hi>James</hi> to diſown ſuch an Alliance with <hi>France</hi> which he Rejected, and yet found that his People were allarm'd with the Report of it, which was deſignedly ſpread abroad.</p>
            <p>And what Reaſon can this Author give why King <hi>James</hi> ſhould not diſown it, ſince there was no ſuch Thing? And that his Principle of truſting entirely to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them know ſo much, ſhould oblige him to diſown an Alliance which he had Rejected, meerly out of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them? This Biſhop <hi>Maloony</hi> ſays, And that <hi>This fair Politick,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>hindered him</hi> (King <hi>James</hi>) <hi>from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a Catholick Army that would ſtick to him, inſtead of a Proteſtant one that betray'd him; hindered him alſo from having any Succor from</hi> France <hi>offered him.</hi> There is none here but knows that Succor was offer'd him <hi>from France</hi> againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and that he Rejected it. Now who would ever Gueſs that the aboveſaid <hi>French League</hi> could be prov'd from hence? From theſe Words of Biſhop <hi>Maloony</hi>'s Letter! which ſpeak the direct contrary. Yet this is all our Author's Proof, and he boaſts in it, and crys out, <hi>This is the very Source and Fountain of all the preſent Calamities of</hi> Europe, <hi>but more particularly of ours.</hi> Is not this Magnificent! This is a Hardineſs of no common Hero. To bring, without a Bluſh, the ſtrongeſt Objection againſt him, as an Argument for him. What better Proof could have been brought, to ſhew there was no ſuch League, than the Confeſſion of a Popiſh Biſhop, one of their Managers, in a Letter from <hi>Paris</hi> to his Correſpondent, another Popiſh Biſhop who was Secretary of State in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and which neither of them De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd ſhould ever be ſeen by Proteſtants?

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59238:25"/>and not ſpeak their Thoughts freely to one another? Would they tell one another that King <hi>James</hi> had Rejected the <hi>French Alliance,</hi> if it were not ſo? Yet theſe very Words of this Biſhop, our Author brings to prove that there was ſuch an Alliance.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, there is ſtill a <hi>Jealcuſy</hi> of theſe Things. Our Author has barr'd that from being any Pretence againſt <hi>the plain and certain Duty of Obedience to Lawful Governors.</hi> Yet theſe our Author names among the Pretences for throwing off our Lawful Governors, as well in this Book, as in his ſaid Thankſgiving Sermon; which I ſhall have more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mention hereafter.</p>
            <p>I only name this, to ſhew you his way of Arguing; and withal to tell you that they are ſuch Things, of which, he (at that Diſtance from Affairs, and his Correſpondence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd) could have no other Account than from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>News Letters,</hi> and <hi>Obſervators,</hi> and ſuch ſmall Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencers. And yet he would put this upon us (who live nearer the Helm, and know the value of theſe <hi>Coffee-houſe Papers</hi>) as ſuch infallible Proofs, that it is not in our Power not to ſee, and be convinc'd of their Truth.</p>
            <p>But this is no new Matter. It is the conſtant and never-failing Method in all Rebellions and Commotions of State. They all ſay their Grievances are <hi>apparent</hi> and <hi>undoubted:</hi> And generally the greater the Calumny, the Aſſeverations are the more <hi>poſitive,</hi> to make it be believ'd. <hi>Matchiavil</hi> preſcribes, <hi>fortiter Calumniare,</hi> Beſpatter confidently; Throw much Dirt, ſome will ſtick.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59238:25"/>There are many, very many, in <hi>England</hi> of that Opinion; and ſo poſitive in it, that they think all Men mad, or obſtinately prejudic'd, who offer to deny it; or, in our Author's Words, they think that <hi>the Conſciences of Mankind cannot but ſee it, and be convinc'd of the Truth of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet there are many who will not confeſs it, but think King <hi>Charles</hi> to have been a good Man, and a <hi>Martyr;</hi> and that he ſtood up more for the Laws, and Liberty of the Subject, than his illegal Murtherers, or Depoſers; who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended more againſt the Law, and much more <hi>apparently</hi> by their Rebelling againſt him, than he did, if all they charg'd him with had been true. <hi>Our Author himſelf was once of this Opinion.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And beſides this poſitive Aſſurance which they had, they likewiſe (as our Author) had the Faculty of improving a Breach of Promiſe, or an Arbitrary Deſign, into a Deſign againſt their very <hi>Lives.</hi> Becauſe he diſappointed them, as <hi>they were very ſure,</hi> in their Inheritance in their Fields and Vineyards, and had a mind to make himſelf more Arbitrary, <hi>altogether a Prince over them,</hi> therefore they charg'd him with a Deſign to <hi>kill them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Author's Diſtinction of Evil.</note>N. 3. of his Introduction was deſign'd to obviate this, its Title in the Heads of Diſcourſe is in theſe Words, <hi>The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Paſſive Obedience from Reaſon and Scripture reach only Caſes where the Miſchief is Particular or Tolerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this gives us no ſurer Marks than we had before. For what does he mean by <hi>Tolerable?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tolerable.</note> If it be as much as a Man can bear. No Paſſive-Obedience-man can ſtretch it higher. Since no Man can bear more than he can.</p>
            <p>Therefore he muſt mean, what a Man can bear <hi>Eaſily,</hi> or till he begins to think the Burthen to be <hi>Intolerable,</hi> that is <hi>Hard to be born,</hi> and then you may be ſure he will not let it grow too heavy for him.</p>
            <p>And no Rebel in the World can deſire a greater Latitude than this. For whenever he ſays he is hurt, or has a mind to bear no more, then no more Paſſive Obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Word <hi>Tolerable.</hi> Now for the other Qualification,<note place="margin">Univerſal.</note> 
               <hi>viz. Particular;</hi> that is, as he explains it, p. 3. <hi>when the Miſchief is not Univerſal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Univerſal,</hi> may be either as to its <hi>Tendency;</hi> that is, where a Miſchief done to a particular Perſon may be a Precedent to have the like done to another, and another, and ſo till it comes to be <hi>Univerſal.</hi> And in this Senſe our Author will not allow that any Miſchief from a Government can be <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> If the King take one Man's Life or Property from him contrary to Law; this will not be call'd a <hi>particular</hi> Caſe, but the Caſe of the whole Kingdom. Thus Mr. <hi>Hamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> conteſted his Aſſeſſment (which was about 20 Shillings) and brought on the whole Caſe of <hi>Ship-money,</hi> which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil'd the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. <hi>Magdalen-College</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59238:26"/>was not thought a <hi>particular</hi> Caſe, and did no ſmall Service againſt King <hi>James</hi> 2. In ſhort, all Miſchief is done to ſome <hi>Particulars,</hi> and <hi>Univerſal</hi> is but many <hi>Particulars:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what is done to one, may be inferred to the reſt; and in this Senſe no Miſchief can be <hi>Particular.</hi> Will this Author ſay, that the Buſineſs of <hi>Glenco</hi> (n. 19. Appendix) was only a <hi>particular</hi> Miſchief?</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if by an <hi>univerſal</hi> Miſchief, you mean where the Miſchief does, not only in its <hi>Tendency,</hi> but <hi>Actually</hi> aſſect the <hi>Univerſal,</hi> that is, the <hi>whole</hi> People. In this Senſe, it is not <hi>Univerſal,</hi> if <hi>any part</hi> of the People be Excepted. And then, according to our Author's own Rules, Paſſive Obedience takes place in all Caſes, except where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment deſigns the Deſtruction of <hi>the whole People,</hi> that is, as <hi>Grotius</hi> has explain'd it, where the Governors are all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be <hi>mad.</hi> Which has been ſpoke to already.</p>
            <p>But not to take any Advantage of this (for no King, not <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> was ever ſo mad as to deſign the Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>a part</hi> of his People; Then the Queſtion will be, Whether it be greater Deſtruction to the People to run the hazard of this, under the Protection of God, while in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands, rather than to raiſe a Civil War to Remedy this?</p>
            <p>And our Author ſeems to anſwer this, n. 4. of his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, which bears this Title. <hi>A War not always a greater Evil than Suffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve here the <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and withal the <hi>Cunning</hi> of our Author. He calls it <hi>a War;</hi> which is a general Word, and therefore may lead you off the Queſtion; which is not at all concerning <hi>Lawful War,</hi> as that may be betwixt Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Princes, But concerning Subjects Levying War againſt the King, or the Government, under which they Live; which therefore is called <hi>Rebellion.</hi> And it is of this only that our Queſtion proceeds, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>Suffering,</hi> be the greateſt Evil?</p>
            <p>And our Author ſays, <hi>It is not always a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er Evil than Suffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was Cautious indeed. It is not <hi>always</hi> ſo. But what if it be ſo <hi>for the moſt part?</hi> Is it therefore to be Choſen?
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59238:27"/>This, or nothing, is our Author's meaning. He begins this, n. 4. p. 5. thus. If then <hi>in ſome Caſes</hi> the Miſchiefs of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting — may be worſe— than a War— which is beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Queſtion, and point blank contrary to the Law of the Land, and which this Author has often ſubſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch a War (of Subjects taking Arms againſt the King) is not Lawful; <hi>upon any Pretence whatſoever.</hi> Which if it be true, then our Author's, <hi>in ſome Caſes,</hi> is but a Deceit. For the Law allows of <hi>no ſuch Caſes,</hi> nor <hi>any Pretence whatever,</hi> to take Arms againſt the King.</p>
            <p>One would think it pretty hard for our Author to get over this.<note place="margin">A Paſſage out of <hi>Faulkner</hi> miſapply'd.</note> He attempts it (but faintly,) c. 1. n. 8. p. 10. where he ſays, <hi>That this may not ſeem a new Doctrine, I would have the Reader obſerve, that I only tranſcribe the learned</hi> Faulkner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why? Who ſaid it was a new Doctrine? Was that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? No doubt, many have, and do hold it. In the next place, ſuppoſe you do tranſcribe <hi>Faulkner,</hi> will that excuſe you? You will not ſtand by all that <hi>Faulkner</hi> ſays in that Book, for you know no Man is more oppoſite to your <hi>now</hi> Opinion, if it be your Opinion. Why then do you Quote one part of him, if you will not believe another? For either he muſt contradict himſelf (and then his Authority cannot be great either way) or elſe you lay no value upon his Judgment, while you plainly diſpute againſt his Notion of Paſſive Obedience, which you cannot deny, and is viſible to every one that reads his Book, and I will ſhew you preſently when I come to examine his Quotations more at large.</p>
            <p>But our Author has pick'd up this Sentence out of him. And though all the Words our Author quotes are in <hi>Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s Chriſtian Loyalty, l. 2. c. 5. l. 2. n. 19. yet I muſt charge him with a falſe Quotation; for he leaves out ſuch Words, as plainly ſhew, that <hi>Faulkner</hi> does not ſet this down as his own Opinion, but only to follow upon a Suppoſition, which he Quotes out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> but does not ſay that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it. <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks, ſays he, that <hi>ultimo Neceſſitatis preſidio,</hi> ſuch defence is not to be condemned— <hi>And if this be true,</hi> ſays <hi>Faulkner, it muſt be upon this Ground, that ſuch Attempts of Ruining, do</hi> ipſo facto <hi>include a diſclaiming the Governing of thoſe Perſons, as Subjects, and conſequently of being
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59238:27"/>their Prince or King; And then the Expreſſions of our publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Acknowledgment would ſtill be ſecured, that it is not Lawful upon any Pretence whatſoever to take Arms againſt the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Faulkner,</hi> as our Author quotes him; and all he ſays is, that upon the Suppoſition of a King diſclaiming the Government, and conſequently, ceaſing to be King, then though we do take Arms againſt him, we do not break the aboveſaid Declaration, of not taking Arms againſt the King, becauſe then he is no King. For a King that <hi>diſclaims</hi> the Government is no longer King; and, ſays <hi>Faulkner,</hi> if <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>'s Poſition be true, it muſt be upon this Ground. But he does not ſay that <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Suppoſition is true. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, in the very next Words, as if it were confuting this Opinion of <hi>Grotius,</hi> he quotes an Authority againſt him, which is Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> (whom our Author too quotes) for having ſet down this Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> with what he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to be the Ground of it, he immediately ſubjoyns a contrary Authority. <hi>But Biſhop</hi> Bilſon, ſays he, <hi>ſpeaking of ſuch Popiſh Cruelties,</hi> adds, <hi>That if the Laws of the Land do not permit them to guard their Lives, when they are aſſaulted with unjuſt Force againſt Law, or if they take Arms, as you do, to depoſe Princes we will never excuſe them from Rebellion.</hi> Thus <hi>Bilſon.</hi> as <hi>Faulkner</hi> there quotes him.</p>
            <p>Now judge what reaſon this Author had to produce this Paſſage of <hi>Faulkner,</hi> and how ſore the was put to it, when he could find nothing elſe to ſay, to bring himſelf off from that Declaration, which, purſuant to the Law of the Land, he had ſo ſolemnly read in the Preſence of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>His Church,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Divine Service.</hi>

               <hi>and not ſo miſchievous in the Conſequence as a</hi> Civil War. Thus our Author.</p>
            <p>And indeed he has given advantage enough againſt him, in this Compariſon, which he advances of the Evils of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or a <hi>Civil War,</hi> as he more gracefully Words it.</p>
            <p>For do but bear with any <hi>King,</hi> and think nothing <hi>Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> from him, till he deſtroy as many as a <hi>Civil War,</hi>— I will not take the full advantage of the Compariſon; Do but ſtay till he deſtroys the <hi>thouſand</hi> part as many, or bring ſuch <hi>univerſal</hi> Ruin and Devaſtation to the Kingdom, and I'll undertake there is no Paſſive-Obedience-man in the World but would conclude him as <hi>mad</hi> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and no more to be obey'd than a Man Raging in a Feaver. So vaſt a Diſproportion there is 'twixt the Evils of <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Rebellion!</hi> So much is the <hi>Remedy</hi> worſe than the <hi>Diſeaſe!</hi> The Cruelty of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> ſays one, is like a Clap of <hi>Thunder,</hi> it ſtrikes with great terror: But a <hi>Civil War</hi> is like an <hi>Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> which ſweeps down all before it without noiſe. Thus one Man brought upon the Scaffold by the Arbitrary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> makes more noiſe than Ten thouſand kill'd in the Field in a <hi>Civil War.</hi> But that does not make the Evil the leſs, but the greater, while we are made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deſtroy our ſelves: And do it more effectually in one day, than the bloodieſt Tyrant could find in Heart to do in his whole Reign. All the Men put to death by the Arbitrary Command of Tyrants ſince the beginning of the World, in all the Kingdoms of the World, will not amount to half the Number of thoſe who periſhed in the <hi>Roman,</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Civil Wars: Thoſe who have periſhed within theſe Three years in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are many more than all the <hi>Engliſh Tyrants</hi> ever put to death. So much ſafer are we in God's hands, than in our own! In their hands where God has plac'd us; and though he often makes them, like the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> ſcourges for our Sin, yet he has promis'd to keep their hearts in his hand, and to turn them as ſeemeth beſt to him;<note place="margin">Prov. 21.1.</note> we have more promiſe of Safety there, than when we are delivered over to <hi>the Beaſts of the People,</hi> whoſe mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>David</hi> compares the <hi>Raging of the Sea.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 68.30.</note> In ſhort, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59238:28"/>Reſtraint of Government, is the true <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of the People; ſince if they were at Liberty from Government, they would be expos'd to one another, which would be the greaten <hi>Slavery</hi> in the World. The great Miſtake is in the fooliſh Notion we have of <hi>Liberty,</hi> which generally is thought to conſiſt in being <hi>free</hi> from the Laſh of Government, as School-boys from their Maſter; and proves, in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence only a Liberty to deſtroy one another.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">This Author's Remedy for Tyranny to kill half the Nation.</note>And yet to purchaſe this Liberty, our Author thinks it worth the while to cut the Throats of one half of the Nation.

            </p>
            <p>Here is a terrible Sentence! one half of a Nation cut down at a Blow! we muſt expect ſome very good Reaſon for this. He ſays, <hi>An Age or two will repair the Loſs of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects — But if Liberty be Loſt it is never to be retrieved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I thought the quite contrary to this had been true. That Men might be Reſcu'd from <hi>Priſon,</hi> but not from <hi>Death.</hi> That therefore. <hi>Liberty</hi> might be retriev'd, but <hi>Lives</hi> never. He ſays, <hi>An Age or two will repair the Loſs of Lives;</hi> that is, <hi>other Men</hi> will live. But does that Retrieve thoſe that are Loſt? He may as well ſay, That I regain my Liberty, if another Man gets his Liberty. But he ſays, <hi>If Liberty be loſt it is never to be retrieved.</hi> Why then would he Sacrifice half the Nation to ſeek to retrieve it? He ſays, <hi>It brings certain and infallible Deſtruction.</hi> And will he contend againſt <hi>Infallible</hi> Deſtruction?</p>
            <p>I would ask, whether he thinks the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtants did not looſe their <hi>Liberty</hi> under King <hi>James?</hi> If they did not, His whole Book is falſe.

            <p>But let us ſee if we can find out the Reaſon of this ſtrange Aſſertion. And you have it not obſcurely hinted, in the Words immediately before; <hi>viz. And indeed the greateſt Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of a Civil War, is the Danger of ſubjecting the State to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59238:29"/>Abſolute Power of ſome potent General, as it hapned at</hi> Rome, Florence, <hi>and in</hi> England, <hi>in the late Civil War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed is the Miſchief and Danger of a Civil War. Since the ſame Power that enabled your Deliverer to Reſcue you, will enable him alſo to keep the Power when he has got it. And who will not keep it, when it is in his Power? As <hi>Oliver</hi> did in the late <hi>Civil War</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and happen'd in <hi>Rome, Florence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But now our Author has told us the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> he ought to have given us the <hi>Remedy,</hi> if he knows any. For you cannot take Arms againſt a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> but under the Command of ſome <hi>General.</hi> And then how do you know but he will prove a <hi>Tyrant?</hi> It is natural for Men to affect <hi>Abſoluteneſs.</hi> Who Loves to be Controul'd? We muſt always be under the Power of ſome or other, and the effect of a Revolution is but Changing the Perſon; wherein you muſt run a Hazard; for as one ſaid upon a certain occaſion, <hi>There is nothing ſo like as Two Kings.</hi> And it is a terrible ſort of a Cure, to ſlaughter half the Nation upon an Experiment, which our Author himſelf confeſſes to be very <hi>uncertain,</hi> or indeed <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,</hi> to have any good Effect, if loſt Liberty cannot be retrieved, but the Danger and the Miſchief is certain. And our Author does not ſee a Remedy. It is the common Fate of theſe Rebellions for Liberty, to be made a Prey to their Deliverers: And then half the People muſt be deſtroy'd by a new Deliverer, to gain Liberty to the other half. And if they be miſtaken in the Man, then half of the remaining half muſt go: And if they be miſtaken again, then half of that half, and ſo on for ever. This is our Author's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt for Liberty. And he ſays, It is for the Good of the People.</p>
            <p>Of which People? I beſeech you, of thoſe that are Kill'd to gain Liberty for the reſt? But how do you compute the Good of the People? Is it not from the Major part? This Author, I have heard, is a good Mathematician, he cannot be miſtaken Reckoning.</p>
            <p>Now if half of the People be deſtroy'd, to purchaſe Liberty to the reſt, here is no <hi>Good</hi> but <hi>Hurt</hi> done to the <hi>People:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is greater Hurt done to the one half of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59238:29"/>People, than the fancy'd Good can be to the other. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Author has not repreſented himſelf in his own mind, to be one of that half which was to be Deſtroy'd: But being one of the ſurviving half, he thinks it beſt the other half ſhould be Deſtroy'd, to purchaſe Liberty for thoſe that remain. But if this Experiment be repeated a a ſecond Time, and half of the remaining half be taken off, then there is no Compariſon, but this muſt be for the <hi>Hurt</hi> of the People. Eſpecially conſidering that this Principle opens a door to an Eternal Halfing them at this Rate. And we may ſee it by Experience where this Doctrine obtains, that that Country (I am ſorry <hi>England</hi> ſhould come into the Account) ſeldom enjoys a longer Reſpite from the Ruin of one Revolution, than to take breath, feed up, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for another: And what can prevent it, where People are thus Diſciplin'd and Encourag'd to Rebellion? And have a never-failing Pretence given them to Kick when-ever they are Wanton? Nothing but a Miracle can ſtop them, till Ruin upon Ruin has humbled them, and convinc'd them by Demonſtration of the pernicious Conſequence of theſe looſe Principles of Government.</p>

It is by many Degrees the Greateſt and moſt <hi>Lawleſs Tyranny</hi> of the two; and always brings greater Evils, Confuſion, Diſorder, Rapin, Violence, Contempt of Laws, and Legal Eſtabliſhments, more <hi>intolerable</hi> Miſchiefs of all Sorts, than thoſe it pretends to Remedy.</p>
            <p>But of all Pretences for Rebellion, <hi>Religion</hi> is the moſt Ridiculous; becauſe a Civil War introduces greater <hi>Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> looſens the Reins of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit of <hi>True Religion</hi> than any other Thing in the World.

            <p>I deſire this Author to make a juſt Computation betwixt the Godlineſs of the Proteſtant Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the common ſtrain of Wickedneſs which was Practic'd there before by the People in time of Peace.</p>
            <p>I have been told that this Author did expreſs his juſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt the wild and bare-fac'd Debauchery of the Army, from his Pulpit in <hi>Dublin,</hi> ſo far as to ſay, It was come to that paſs, that it was a Scandal for any Woman of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59238:30"/>Reputation to be ſeen in Company with a <hi>Red</hi> or a <hi>Blew</hi> Coat; for which he incurr'd the heavy Diſpleaſure of the Sparks and Beau's in the Army; who practis'd all mad Lewdneſs and Prophanity with both hands earneſtly, with all their Strength and Power, with the ſame Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor that they Ruſht into the Battle. They thought the one as much their Duty as the other. Dr. <hi>Gorge,</hi> in his Letter from the Camp, (n. 2. Appendix) tells us, That <hi>they thought Religion but Canting, and Debauchery the neceſſary Character of of Soldiers.</hi> And he had good Reaſon to know, being at that time Secretary to the General.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe is notorious, all Men know it. The truth is, that Army has Debauched generally all that they have left alive in that Kingdom; and have left the Marks of their Wickedneſs as deeply imprinted in that Country as of their unbridl'd Violence, Plunder, Burning, and Deſtruction of Proteſtants and Friends as well as Enemies. This War has taught thoſe People Wickedneſs they never knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; in compariſon, they never knew what Wickedneſs was before.</p>
            <p>Now let us compute how <hi>Religion</hi> is ſerv'd by all this: The Spirit of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is let looſe, and has overſpread all the Land; It is the Common-place of all our Men of Wit to run down and ridicule the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and all <hi>Reveal'd Religion,</hi> and this Publickly, in Coffee-houſes, every where, without any Reſtraint or Shame: So far from that, that they Laugh at and Deſpiſe all thoſe who pretend to believe the <hi>Revelations</hi> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> or that God ever ſpoke to any Man, or gave them any Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any body elſe, other than by giving Men Wiſdom to invent good Laws, as <hi>Solon, Licurgus,</hi> or the like: And no other Account do they make of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſorry to ſay it, that I am a Witneſs to the truth of this; if it needed any Witneſs, for it is notorious and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but more within theſe Four years, and more Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly own'd, than ſince we knew the World.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we have loſt <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> both as to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practiſe.</hi> This is the Advantage <hi>Religion</hi> has gain'd by our <hi>Wars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59238:31"/>But all is no matter, ſo we beat down <hi>Popery.</hi> And yet Popery was never more Tolerated in <hi>Ireland</hi> than ſince the Concluſion of our War againſt Popery, even by the Articles and Agreements of the War. And how freely it is Tolerated in <hi>England</hi> we all know. Nay, it is taken ill if any call this a Religious War. Are we not Confederate with the moſt Bigot Popiſh Princes in Chriſtendom? But we will keep <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> out of <hi>England</hi> for the time to come.</p>
            <p>If it be by letting in <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> or <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> it were better keep the old <hi>Popery</hi> ſtill. This is the Method to reconcile Men to <hi>Popery,</hi> when they ſee you advance in its place Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples more <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> than it ſelf, and introduce them by all the Wicked and Prophane Practiſes in the World.</p>
            <p>To my knowledge ſeveral have turn'd Papiſts, and more are in danger, from the Scandal of this Revolution, the <hi>Lewdneſs</hi> of the <hi>Army,</hi> and baſe <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as they call it, have turn'd their hearts againſt us, they think we have no Religion. It may ſeem a Paradox, but it is true, That there have been more Converts to Popery in <hi>England</hi> theſe laſt Four years, than in the Four years before.</p>
            <p>Indeed all that King <hi>James</hi> was a doing did prove to the Ruin of <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> And if he had been ſuffer'd to go on, he had turn'd all <hi>Engliſh</hi> hearts, for ever, againſt it: So far were we from the Danger of <hi>Popory</hi> in his Reign. But now Men's Rage at <hi>Popery</hi> is abated, by ſeeing the very wicked Artifices have been uſed againſt it: I wiſh our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to keep it out do not bring it in.</p>
            <p>It is a Rule that ſeldom fails, but never almoſt in <hi>Religion,</hi> That Civil War and Rebellion prove in the end to be the Deſtruction and Undoing of thoſe good Things which are made the Pretences, and for the Preſervation of which Men are perſwaded to <hi>Rebel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is commonly the end of Reformations made by the Sword, eſpecially of Subjects againſt their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
            <p>And it is for ſuch a Reformation as this, that our Author can give up the half of the Nation to the Slaughter. And all the Care he takes, is, <hi>An Age or two will repair the Loſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59238:31"/>of Subjects.</hi> Murther will be a ſmall Sin upon this Account. It was counted a Tyrannical Expreſſion in the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> when one told him, That he expos'd his Men too much in the Storm of a Town; he replied, <hi>There are as many Baſtards gotten in</hi> Paris <hi>laſt Night, as I ſhall looſe Men to Day.</hi> But this was modeſt, by many Degrees, to the fierce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this Author. He had not time, in his Fury, to conſider the Reaſon God gives, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. why ſhedding of Man's Blood is ſo Grievous a Sin in his Sight, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it from the Beaſts of the Field, much more from his Guilty Brother.</p>
            <p>This Author makes nothing of deſtroying the Image of God; What is the Matter? Another Age will get more <hi>Images.</hi> This was ſpoke like a <hi>Divine!</hi> But, good Sir, there is ſomething elſe, which, if you would give me leave, I would preſume to mind you of, in your own Profeſſion, which is, The care of <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, in this Slaughter you make of <hi>Bodies,</hi> there will ſome <hi>Souls</hi> be loſt: And <hi>an Age or two will not Repair that.</hi> I am ſorry this did not come into your Conſideration. For in this Revolution which you ſuppoſe, and in which you are content to Sacrifice half the Nation (you reckon about the Number it coſt in your Country, as themſelves compute it.) In this Quarrel, Sir, you cannot ſuppoſe both Parties to be in the Right. There muſt be <hi>Rebels</hi> on one ſide or other.</p>
            <p>And you uſed to tell us, That <hi>Rebellion</hi> was a <hi>damning Sin.</hi> And is it nothing, in your Account, to ſend half the <hi>Souls</hi> of the Nation to <hi>Hell!</hi> Are theſe the Bowels of a Spiritual Guide! Good God! Whether are we come! Here is no face of Chriſtianity! This is propagating Religion with the <hi>Sword,</hi> beyond the Principles of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will an Age or two cure the Infection of univerſal Debauchery and Prophaneneſs which this Civil War has ſpread over the Face of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and in proportion of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> where the Armies have come? Does this Author find it ſo eaſy a Task to remove all Lewdneſs and Prophanity where it has once taken root? Or to hinder it to Deſcend to the next Generation? And it is not only <hi>this War,</hi> but it has been obſerv'd of <hi>War</hi> in all Ages, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys Men's Principles, takes them off all Foundations of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59238:32"/>Sobriety, and inſtills a Diſſoluteneſs of Life, and an Inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Difregard of Religion, and of all Rules of Juſtice 'twixt Man and Man, moſt of any Thing in the World: And of all Wars, ſuch univerſal Corruption of Manners is moſt fruitful in a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and ſticks longeſt to our Poſterities; leaves Seeds of Animoſities, till one Revolution begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and entails <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction, Hatred, Treachery, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi> and <hi>all Wickedneſs,</hi> from Generation to Generation. And no Evils theſe can Cure, are ſo <hi>Intolerable</hi> as theſe.</p>
            <p>This made ſome of our Forefathers of ſo much a contrary Opinion to this Author, as to make it a Proverb, That the <hi>worſt Peace</hi> is more Eligible than the <hi>beſt War:</hi> However, from the Conſideration above ſaid, of all Pretences, <hi>Religion</hi> is the moſt Ridiculous for a <hi>Civil War;</hi> becauſe a <hi>Civil War</hi> is more deſtructive to <hi>Religion</hi> than any Thing it can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>There is another Thing this Author has forgot, while he had his Eyes upon nothing but new <hi>Bodies</hi> of Men being rais'd up next Age, and ſo all the Evils of this to be done away. God has threatned to viſit the Sins of the <hi>Fathers</hi> upon the <hi>Children</hi> to the third and fourth Generation. <hi>His Blood be on us and our Children,</hi> (Matth. 27.25.) lyes heavy upon the Jews to this Day.</p>
            <p>And, Sir, that Ocean of Blood ſpilt in one of your Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions muſt lye at ſome door or other; And an Age or two will not do away the Guilt of this. I am afraid the Blood of <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, and all ſhed in that <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt him, lyes ſtill upon theſe Nations. They cannot Repent, while they maintain the ſame Principles which rais'd that Rebellion. They are come to that, that they are not afraid, nor aſham'd publickly in <hi>Print,</hi> and in <hi>Coffee-houſes,</hi> to juſtifie that <hi>Civil War,</hi> as our Author would call it, againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt. In this Years Almanacks, ſold about the Streets (<hi>Partridge</hi>'s Almanack for the Year 1692.) the 30th. of <hi>January</hi> is left out, with <hi>Good-friday, Aſhwedneſday,</hi> and other Superſtitious Days: And inſtead of theſe, he puts into his Chronology ſome of the black Aſperſions caſt upon King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, as the Murther of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, and what he thinks were the Arbitrary Proceedings of his Reign, and ſetting up of Popery. And he reckons
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59238:32"/>as Feſtivals, the Succeſſes of the <hi>Parliament</hi> Army againſt the King; as the Battle at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> Fatal, ſays he, to the <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſo he ſtyles the <hi>Loyal Party.</hi> He tells you of that King's <hi>deſerting</hi> his Parliament (which is as good as <hi>Abdication</hi>) of his <hi>diſpenſing Judges,</hi> &amp;c. and Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> being Beheaded for Treaſon againſt the <hi>Nation.</hi> That was the ſtyle of <hi>Treaſon</hi> in theſe days; and beſt lik'd ſtill, ſet up even by this Author, who give Army, Treaſury, and all from the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Nation,</hi> as before is told. Theſe are ſmall Signs of Repentance. And therefore we have but ſmall hopes, that this Age is yet free'd from the Blood ſpilt the two or three laſt Ages. In which there is yet a farther Conſideration; and that is,</p>
            <p>That Children may not only ſuffer Temporal Puniſhments for the Sins of their Fathers: But that Men may really make other Mens Sins their own, by Approving and Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them; Nay, but by conſenting to them; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> reckon'd himſelf Guilty of the Murther of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he only held their Clothes who ſtoned him. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him,</hi> or, <hi>that thou bear not Sin for him,</hi> as our Margent reads it. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. This is every Man's Duty: But eſpecially of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are appointed by God, <hi>Watch-men,</hi> for this very purpoſe. And if God will require at their hands the Blood of all the Souls that Periſh through their Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or Cowardiſe, in not warning them againſt their Sin, as we are expreſly told, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. What will become of thoſe <hi>Clergy-men?</hi> What will their Judgment be, who lead their Flocks by their Example to Sin? Who juſtifie and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Sin? And imploy their Wit and their Learning to find out Diſtinctions and Salvoes, to keep their Flocks from Returning and Repenting? Who defend or palliate the Wickedneſs of former Ages, to give Countenance to the Crying Sins of this, That (as our Saviour told the Jews, <hi>Matt.</hi> 23.35, 36.) all the Blood ſhed in all former Ages from <hi>Abel</hi> may come upon <hi>this Generation?</hi> Surely thoſe <hi>Clergy</hi> who plead for the Murthers and Rebellions of former Times, make themſelves more Guilty of that Blood than many of the Ignorant hands that ſhed it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59238:33"/>And thus we may not only bring upon our ſelves the Blood which we incourage other Men to ſpill in our own Time, and what has been ſpilt in former Ages, by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it; But we involve our ſelves more expreſly in the Guilt of the Blood that ſhall be ſpilt to the end of the World, by the Influence of our Actions, or Writings: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to incourage and contribute towards the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a Sin, is in ſome ſort being the Author of it; at leaſt, it is being Guilty of it in a nearer degree than only approving of it, when it is done.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations I earneſtly recommend to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's ſecond Thoughts; that he may have a view of the vaſt Sin he has run himſelf into, if his new Principles do not hold; The Blood that is, has been, or ſhall be ſpilt upon this Quarrel to the end of the World. Some conjecture, That the Reaſon of <hi>Dives</hi> being ſo importunate for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Brethren, was not out of Charity to their Souls, which is not ſuppos'd to be in damn'd Spirits; but becauſe his Sufferings increas'd in Hell to the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that his Example upon Earth incourag'd others to Sin, whereby we may ſuppoſe his Brethren to have been chiefly Infected. The Application I make, is, the Danger of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any thing to Poſterity in Writing, which may in the leaſt favour any Sin, eſpecially that of <hi>Blood,</hi> which crys till it be avenged.</p>
            <p>And the greater credit our Author's Book has with ſome for of People, its infection will be the greater, and he have the more to Anſwer for. Therefore he ought to be very ſure that his Reaſons are good, upon which he Pawns the Salvation of his own Soul, and of ſo many Millions.</p>
            <p>With this Preparation I hope he will look again with an impartial Eye upon theſe Reaſons he has produc'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether they will bear ſuch a Weight, as he has laid upon them.</p>
            <p>He ſays, p. 3. n. 3. <hi>If we look into Hiſtory we ſhall find the beſt, the happieſt, and moſt proſperous People, moſt jealous of their Liberty, and while they continue firm in their Reſolution of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it againſt the Enchroachments of their Governors, even with the hazard of their Lives, they have continued Great and Happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59238:33"/>This is but <hi>ſaying,</hi> inſtead of <hi>proving;</hi> and it is abſolutely denied: You have ſeen the Opinion of a <hi>Roman</hi> and a <hi>Greek, Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> upon the Caſe; and many more are to be produc'd, to ſhew that <hi>Rome</hi> and other Countries were never ſo miſerable as in their Conteſts for <hi>Liberty</hi> againſt their Governors.

            <p>Therefore we know not well how to compute the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this ſtaggering Commonwealth, which is not yet an <hi>hundred</hi> years old, and owes its Life to the Contention of its Neighbours; and by Foreign Wars ſecures Peace at home, which laſts no longer than they can have leiſure and time to worry one another, and ſhew the natural Effects of <hi>Popular</hi> Government, which was worthily celebrated in <hi>Mobbing</hi> the <hi>De-Wits,</hi> and will ſhew it ſelf again when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But notwithſtanding of all this, our Author will allege, that they had reaſon to take Arms, rather than pay theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable <hi>Gabels</hi> and <hi>Taxes</hi> which were impos'd upon them by their King.

            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:59238:34"/>But they fought for <hi>Religion</hi> as well as <hi>Taxes;</hi> and they have got what they fought for, for they pay the <hi>greateſt Taxes</hi> in the World, and they have got <hi>all Religions</hi> in the World.

            <p>He will perhaps ſay, That they grow rich, and thrive by theſe means. No, it is not by theſe means; but their <hi>Scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, Soil,</hi> and other Circumſtances, forces them to <hi>Induſtry;</hi> they muſt <hi>work, ſtarve,</hi> or <hi>drown:</hi> and God has brought them under that happy Neceſſity, to ſhew the World an Example of the great value and force of <hi>Induſtry,</hi> how much it <hi>alone</hi> can do, <hi>without the aſſiſtance of any other Vertue.</hi> Therefore their Caſe will not be a Rule to other Nations.</p>
            <p>But our Author ſays, That <hi>at this day—we ſhall find every Nation Happy and Thriving—according as they have preſerved themſelves from Slavery.</hi> He means <hi>Ireland,</hi> of which he writes, which at this day has glorious Effects of <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Thriving</hi> to ſhew, being reduc'd to a <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs</hi> from a <hi>Noble</hi> and a <hi>Plentiful</hi> Countrey, and <hi>one half</hi> of the Souls in it are <hi>Periſhed,</hi> and <hi>all Impoveriſhed,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pretence of <hi>Preſerving themſelves from Slavery.</hi> He ſays, All Countreys under unlimited Monarchies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in their Strength and Improvements.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe are occaſional Obſervations of this Author, who would have you believe them without examining. I haſten to give you a further view of his ſtrain of Argumentation.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen already the bent and force of all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>viz.</hi> That a King who does <hi>deſign</hi> to deſtroy <hi>one part</hi> of his People, does thereby <hi>Abdicate</hi> the Government of thoſe whom he <hi>deſigns</hi> to deſtroy. But King <hi>James</hi> had this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland, ergo,</hi> he proves that King <hi>James</hi> had this Deſign, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. whoſe Title is,<note place="margin">Seventh Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Deſtroying our Religion.</note> That <hi>King</hi> James <hi>deſign'd to deſtroy the Proteſtant Religion.</hi> Now I ſay this is no Conſequence; for he might deſign to root out the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> but not to deſtroy the <hi>Perſons</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; which is the foundation upon which this Author builds all his Arguments. All Governments ſet up ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as the Eſtabliſhed Religion of their Country, and there are none which are in earneſt with Religion but would wiſh all others to be of their Religion: but that therefore they would <hi>deſtroy all</hi> who will not be of their Religion, is
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59238:35"/>our Author's Conſequence; which if it fail, there is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in his Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England,</hi> no doubt, would gladly rid it ſelf of <hi>Popery;</hi> to which end, it is made <hi>Treaſon</hi> to turn <hi>Papiſt;</hi> and their <hi>Prieſts</hi> are baniſhed upon pain of <hi>Death;</hi> and the Law debars <hi>Papiſts</hi> from Places of Truſt, and many Advantages which the other Subjects freely enjoy: But that therefore the Government intends to <hi>cut the Throats</hi> of all the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or thoſe that have now ſubmitted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and therefore has <hi>Abdicated</hi> the Government of them, is the Author's Doctrine, which would be needful for him to explain; for Reaſon is Reaſon in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and whoever ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſuch an Argument in <hi>England,</hi> I'm confident would be looked on by the Government, not only as a very weak and inconſiderable Reaſoner, but that he ought to be animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an invidious, ſeditious, and Treaſonable Incendiary, who by this means endeavoured to render the Government odious, and ſtir up the Subjects to Rebellion.</p>
            <p>The ſame Argument will juſtifie what <hi>Dundee</hi> and the <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> have done in <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the Preſent Government: and it will juſtifie the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party there, if they ſhould take Arms every day, in oppoſition to the preſent Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Kingdom. By the publick printed Accounts of the <hi>Perſecution</hi> and violent <hi>Rabbling</hi> of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Miniſters and others of their Principles, they have ſuffered more from the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> than even this Author was afraid of from King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not only the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Party in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> may juſtifie their taking Arms againſt the Preſent Government when they pleaſe; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts in 41 might have juſtified their Rebellion againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. by this Author's Principles, which do indeed juſtifie all the Rebellions that ever were in the World, or all that can be invented; for none can want ſome of the Pretences which he allows for Rebellion.</p>
            <p>But eſpecially it gives full Liberty to all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to take Arms againſt the Government; but more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Government ſhut them out from Places of Truſt and Profit; for ſuch a jealouſie of them, may eaſily be improved into a Deſign for their <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> But if any <hi>Penal Laws</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59238:35"/>be made againſt them, then the Deſign is <hi>apparent;</hi> it goes beyond a Deſign; it is a real Attempt upon them, actually aſſaulting them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of all things, How could the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who adhered to K. <hi>James</hi> be made Rebels to K. <hi>William</hi> before they ſubmitted to him? How could this be do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e by our Author's Principles?</p>
            <p>If you ſay he had Title to <hi>Ireland,</hi> by being King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ireland</hi> is but an Appendix to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> Anſwer; But <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo;</hi> and the Government of <hi>England</hi> being diſſolved (as you ſay) by <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi> and returned back to the ſuppos'd <hi>Original Contract</hi> or <hi>first Right</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> to erect Government for their own Convenience; of conſequence the Tye which <hi>England</hi> had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Conquest</hi> was diſſolved, and <hi>Ireland</hi> left as well as <hi>England</hi> in their ſuppos'd <hi>Original Freedom,</hi> to chuſe what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Governours they pleas'd. But all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, this Author's Principles freed them from K. <hi>William</hi> becauſe of the Preſumptions they had to think, that K. <hi>William intended</hi> to invade their <hi>Property, Lives</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he came to Eſtabliſh the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion. By his Declaration of Grace, 7 <hi>July</hi> 90, he pardons none, either as to <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Eſtate,</hi> but only <hi>Poor Labourers, Common Souldiers, Country Farmers, Plow men</hi> and <hi>Cottiers,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Citizens, Townſmen, Tradeſmen,</hi> and <hi>Artificers,</hi> who ſhould return by the 1ſt of <hi>August:</hi> and even theſe were to forfeit all but their <hi>perſonal Chattels,</hi> as you will ſee in the Declaration, N. 6. Appendix. And by the publick Reſolution of his Judges 21 <hi>Nov.</hi> 90. (which you will ſee in the Appendix N. 7.) very few had hopes leſt them either of <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Estate</hi> even upon their ſubmitting to King <hi>William,</hi> and living peaceably under his Government, purſuant to his Declarations: And I am told that thouſands of them are out-law'd ſince they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his Protection, notwithſtanding of the many fair Promiſes which were made to them afterward upon ſeveral Occaſions; particularly, General <hi>Ginckle</hi>'s Proclamation printed at <hi>Dublin,</hi> 4 <hi>Feb.</hi> 90. wherein he aſſures the <hi>Iriſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> in their Majeſties Names, that all of them who w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>d ſubmit to their Majeſties Government ſhould be protected as to their <hi>Religion, Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Liberties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe following Words, are <hi>verbatim</hi> the Words of that Proclamation; viz. <hi>Their Majeſties hereby giving demonſtration
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59238:36"/>to the World, that it is not their Deſign to oppreſs the Inhabitants of this Nation, either by</hi> perſecuting <hi>them for their</hi> Religion, Ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>them in their</hi> Eſtates <hi>and</hi> Fortunes, <hi>or</hi> Enſlaving <hi>them in their</hi> Liberty. Theſe are the Words of that Proclamation: which have not hinder'd the multitude of <hi>Out lawrys,</hi> and other Proceedings and Forfeitures againſt thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Government. As to their <hi>Religion,</hi> they do not complain but that K. <hi>William</hi> has been very Gracious to them; and they enjoy it in more ample Manner than ever they had it under any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince: But as to their <hi>Perſons, Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> they cry out heavily of Breach of <hi>Publick Faith,</hi> and Great <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our Author had the improving of theſe and other their Circumſtances, how eaſily could he argue them into the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of taking Arms for their Defence? But if the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Glenco</hi> were on his ſide, no doubt, he would ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Nation to riſe as one Man, and would <hi>Abdicate</hi> all the Governments in the World. It is well for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that this Author is not touched by the late Act impoſing the Oaths in <hi>Ireland;</hi> the Refuſal of which is no leſs than <hi>Premunire,</hi> which does not only invade your <hi>Property,</hi> but makes you uncapable of having any Property at all, ſo much as to the Cloaths upon your Back; or ever to breath the common Air out of a <hi>Jayl;</hi> and none above eighteen years of Age, no not <hi>Women</hi> of any ſort, <hi>Maids, Wives,</hi> or <hi>Widows,</hi> are exempted. What Declamations could our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor make upon this! How far would he make this exceed the <hi>French Dragooning,</hi> or even the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition!</hi> if he had ſuch a Handle againſt King <hi>James!</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Some Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's manner of Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note>I have heard from ſome who are acquainted with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that he is a Man of good Reaſon. But in this Book, I muſt ſay, that his Zeal has tranſported him, to take that for Reaſon which is the fartheſt from it in the World; and which it is impoſſible he ſhould think to be ſo, in any other Caſe.</p>
            <p>C. 3. ſ. 8. n. 6. p. 102. He tells how <hi>Derry</hi> ſhut its Gates againſt the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment: And n. 7. p. 103. he proves they were <hi>obliged to do thus by their Foundation;</hi> and names the Charter granted by K. <hi>James</hi> I. One would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the King ſhould grant a Charter to oppoſe himſelf. The Author's Reaſon is, That this Town was <hi>founded to be a Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Refuge for Proteſtants againſt the Inſurrections and Maſſacres of the Natives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59238:36"/>The <hi>Natives</hi> had before that time made frequent <hi>Rebellions,</hi> and <hi>Derry</hi> was built as a Security againſt <hi>them;</hi> therefore our Author thinks, that if ever it ſhould ſo happen, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould turn <hi>Rebels,</hi> and the <hi>Natives</hi> be <hi>Loyal,</hi> the King's Charter was meant to ſupport the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in their <hi>Rebellion!</hi> This is too extravagant to need Confutation.</p>
            <p>C. 3. ſ. 12. n. 16. p. 154. He inlarges upon the Reaſons they had in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as in <hi>England,</hi> to dread <hi>Papiſts</hi> in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and grounds his Argument from Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; which was not well thought on for his Purpoſe; for though that Parliament did overturn the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and ſet up <hi>Popery</hi> in its place; yet the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>England</hi> thought it their Duty, for Conſcience ſake, to ſuffer Martyrdom under thoſe cruel Laws, rather than to take Arms againſt their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Governours.</p>
            <p>It is a Topick as ill choſen, which he urges in the third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph of n. 18. of the ſame Section, p. 160. where the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he uſes to cure the Folly of thoſe <hi>Jacobites,</hi> who were At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted in the Act of Attairder in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and notwithſtanding that Provocation continue <hi>Jacobites</hi> ſtill, is not from Principles either of <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Conſcience;</hi> but that if K. <hi>James</hi> come again, they were not to hope for <hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Preferment.</hi> This is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to Act out of no other Conſideration but temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; which is ſo great an Imputation, that it ought to have been proved before it was ſuppoſed; but as to the Author's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it ſeems to operate point blank contrary to that for which he brings it. For if that Act of Attainder is ſo worded as that it is not left in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Power to pardon any who are thereby Attainted, as our Author tells us, and conſequently that theſe <hi>Attainted Proteſtants</hi> can have no Security for their <hi>Lives,</hi> much leſs of <hi>Preferment,</hi> under K. <hi>James;</hi> this would ſeem to argue that it cannot be <hi>Temporal Intereſt</hi> which guides theſe Men, or elſe they muſt be very great Fools indeed!</p>
            <p>C. 3. ſ. 17. n. 7. He argues that K. <hi>J.</hi> claim'd a <hi>Deſpotick Power</hi> over the Church, becauſe (the Biſhop being fled) he appointed a Chancellor in the Dioceſe of <hi>Dublin</hi> (who this Author confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes went no further than the Probate of Wills) after <hi>he had taken away the Oath of Supremacy by an Act of his pretended Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument from the taking away of that Oath has been conſider'd already. But I was much ſurpriz'd to ſee this Author
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59238:37"/>give ſuch a handle to K. <hi>J.</hi> to Retort upon K. <hi>W.</hi> that he and his Pretended Parliaments after abrogating the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance, Supremacy, &amp;c.</hi> had by their meer <hi>Lay-Authority</hi> Depriv'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhops and Clergy, and overthrown <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> it ſelf in <hi>Scotland. If K.</hi> J. <hi>had done any thing like this!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Author will not allow the Depriv'd Biſhops to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo much as the Character or Title. See with what Inſolence he ſpeaks, in the ſame place, of the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Galloway. He</hi> (K <hi>J.</hi>) <hi>appointed</hi> (ſays our Author) <hi>one</hi> Gordon, <hi>who call'd himſelf Biſhop of</hi> Galloway <hi>in</hi> Scotland, <hi>to be Chancellor in the Dioceſe of</hi> Dublin: <hi>This</hi> Gordon <hi>was a very Ignorant Lewd Man, and a profeſt Papiſt</hi>— Which was notoriouſly falſe (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> whowere then in <hi>Dublin</hi>) for this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was then, and all along, a <hi>Profeſt Proteſtant;</hi> and, as I have heard, a Man of Learning and Parts.</p>
            <p>But if he had been a <hi>Papiſt</hi> (whether in Maſquerade or otherwiſe) I would gladly know this Author's Opinion, Whether that would have <hi>Un-Biſhop'd</hi> him?</p>
            <p>Had he been Conſecrated in a Flagrant <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and by thoſe who took Part with and Communicated with the <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and conſequently were ſuch themſelves, there had been Ground indeed to Queſtion the Validity of his Orders, and call'd him a <hi>Pretended</hi> Biſhop. But this Author is in Juſtice oblig'd to ſhew upon what account he laid ſo Great an Imputation upon the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Galloway;</hi> and to ſhew his own Principles in this moſt Important Point, upon which he beſtows up and down ſuch Loving Glances, but will not ſpeak out.</p>
            <p>You have now ſeen the Manner and the Strength of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's way of <hi>Reaſoning</hi> upon the Subject in hand, of which many more Inſtances might be given; but I would not detain you.</p>

            <p>This I freely grant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>im, That <hi>Governours</hi> were appointed by God <hi>for the good of the People;</hi> not that the <hi>People</hi> were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated merely for the Pleaſure of a <hi>King,</hi> or a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or any other Governours.</p>
            <p>But then I muſt ſay likewiſe, from the Reaſons which have been partly told above, that it is for the good of the People, not to have that Latitude left them of Riſing up in Arms againſt their Lawful Governours upon any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: becauſe firſt, ſuch Pretences will never be wanting, nor malicious and deſigning Inſtruments to ſet them on foot; and ſecondly, a <hi>Civil War</hi> is of ſo much more miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Conſequence to the People than any Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor can be, or ever was in any Government.</p>
            <p>Next I ſay to our Author's Argument for the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that there is Exception in the Scripture for Works of Mercy to be done on the Sabbath-day; and our Saviour has expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it, as our Author confeſſes. Now let our Author produce any Exceptions in Scripture from the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Obedience to Governours,</hi> and they will be allow'd; otherwiſe this Inſtance is nothing to his purpoſe. There is an Exception likewiſe as to <hi>Marriage,</hi> in the Caſe of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but what is this to any other Caſe ſave that of <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi> or to any other general Command which has no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or Countermand in the Scripture?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice,</hi> ſays the Scripture: Here is ſufficient Authority to prefer <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and it is an Exception from the general Command of <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Let the like be ſhewn as to <hi>Government,</hi> in any of the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which the Author produces, and we have done.</p>
            <p>But let us conſider what that <hi>Mercy</hi> is which the Author would recommend to diſſolve Government: He has told us in the ſame Page, <hi>to ſlaughter even half the Nation in a Civil War for Liberty.</hi> This we have examined already; and this is the tacit Exception he would have us ſuppoſe in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59238:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Obedience to Government as well as in that of the Sabbath.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> is no <hi>tacit</hi> Exception; for though it be not expreſſed in the Fourth Commandment, yet it is in other Scriptures. But the Exception our Author would have to be of the Fifth Command is <hi>tacit</hi> indeed; for there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept nor any approved Example of it in all the Scripture, but many of both to the contrary; which are ſo well known and largely treated of in many Books upon that Subject, that I will not take up your time in ſetting them down here.</p>

The <hi>Jews</hi> were a different People from the <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians,</hi> as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> of different <hi>Manners, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Intereſt.</hi> They did not live mixed with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> nor under their Laws, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but had the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> aſſigned them peculiar to themſelves. They lived more like an <hi>Independent</hi> People than the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> yet they ſuffered the greateſt Oppreſſion from their King that ever was in the World. His Deſign to ruin them was <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> deſtroying their very Children; and they had given no manner of Cauſe or Provocation on their ſide. They durſt not offer Sacrifices to the Lord without apparent danger of being ſton'd to death: ſo that they were oppreſſed moſt Tyrannically in their <hi>Religion</hi> as well as their <hi>Perſons,</hi> which were condemned to the Brick-kills.

            <p>Their <hi>Maſter</hi> was ſtronger, and commanded more Armies than all their Enemies.

               <hi>and what were</hi> Evil <hi>and</hi> Intolerable. <hi>That</hi> a Rebel is worſe than the worſt Prince; <hi>and</hi> Rebellion <hi>worſe than the</hi> worſt Government <hi>of the</hi> worſt Prince <hi>that hitherto hath been.

            </p>

               <hi>for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to deſerve through their Sins to have an evil Prince, and then to Rebel againſt him, were double and treble Evil, by provoking God more to Plague them.

            <p>Theſe are the Rules this Homily ſets down concerning Rebelling againſt <hi>Evil</hi> Princes, <hi>Unkind</hi> Princes, <hi>Cruel</hi> Princes, Princes that be to their Subjects <hi>mortal Enemies,</hi> Princes that are <hi>out of God's favour,</hi> and ſo <hi>hurtful,</hi> and like to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſhew that all this is not meant only of <hi>Particular Perſons,</hi> but of the <hi>whole Nation;</hi> it is thus expreſſed at the end of this Homily, <hi>viz. That the</hi> whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation <hi>(be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe a ſtubborn People) were to be obedient to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59238:42"/>of a</hi> Foreign Heathen <hi>Prince, and this doth prove that</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Rebels, againſt</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Princes, are far worſe than the ſtubborn</hi> Jews, <hi>whom we yet account as the worſt of all People — And howſoever they call themſelves, or be named of others, yet are they indeed no true</hi> Chriſtians <hi>but worſe than</hi> Jews, <hi>worſe than</hi> Heathens, <hi>and ſuch as ſhall never enjoy the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And the third Homily ſpeaks in theſe Words; <hi>How horrible a Sin againſt God and Man</hi> Rebellion <hi>is, cannot poſſibly be expreſſed according to the greatneſs thereof: For he that nameth</hi> Rebellion, <hi>nameth not a ſingular, or one only Sin, as is Theft, Robbery, Murther, and ſuch like; but he nameth the whole Puddle and Sink of all Sins, againſt God and Man, againſt his Prince, his Country, his Country-men, his Parents, his Children, his Kinsfolks, his Friends, and againſt all Men univerſally; all Sins, I ſay, againſt God, and all Men heaped together, nameth he, that nameth</hi> Rebellion — <hi>And beſides the diſhononor done by Rebels unto God's holy Name, by their breaking of their</hi> Oaths <hi>made to their Prince, with the Atteſtation of God's Name, and calling of his Majeſty to Witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the fourth Homily having ſhewn the horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and others, for their Rebellions and Murmurings, <hi>Now,</hi> ſays the Homily, <hi>if ſuch ſtrange and horrible Plagues did fall upon ſuch Subjects, as did only</hi> murmur <hi>and</hi> ſpeak <hi>evil againſt their Heads; What ſhall become of thoſe moſt wicked</hi> Imps of the Devil, <hi>that do</hi> Conſpire, Arm <hi>themſelves,</hi> Allemble <hi>great Numbers of Armed</hi> Rebels, <hi>and</hi> Lead <hi>them with them againſt their Prince and Country,</hi> Spoiling <hi>and</hi> Robbing, Killing <hi>and</hi> Murthering, <hi>all good Subjects that do withſtand them, as many as they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt.— Though not only great Multitudes of the Rude and Raſcal Commons, but ſometime alſo Men of great</hi> Wit, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <hi>and</hi> Authority, <hi>have moved Rebellions againſt their</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Princes. — Though they ſhould pretend ſundry Cauſes, as the</hi> Redreſs of the Commwealth (<hi>which</hi> Rebellion <hi>of all other Miſchiefs doth moſt deſtroy</hi>) <hi>or</hi> Reformation of Religion, (<hi>whereas</hi> Rebellion <hi>is moſt againſt all true Religion</hi>) <hi>though they have made a great Shew of Holy Meaning, by beginning their Rebellion with a Counterfeit Service of God</hi> (<hi>as did wicked</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom <hi>begin his Rebellion with</hi> ſacrificing unto God) — <hi>Yet neither the</hi> Dignity <hi>of</hi> any Perſon, <hi>nor the</hi> Multitude <hi>of any</hi>

But as the Truth of the Goſpel of our Saviour Chriſt being quietly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly taught, though it do cost them their Lives that do teach it, is able to maintain the true Religion; ſo hath a frantick</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>need of ſuch</hi> furious <hi>Maintainers as is</hi> Rebellion, <hi>and ſuch</hi> Patrons <hi>as are</hi> Rebels.—<hi>Now concerning Pretences of any</hi> Redreſs <hi>of the</hi> Commonwealth <hi>made by</hi> Rebels, <hi>every Man that hath half an Eye may ſee how vain they be;</hi> Rebellion <hi>being, as I have before declared, the greareſt</hi> Ruin <hi>and</hi> Deſtruction <hi>of all</hi> Commonwealths <hi>that may be poſſible. — Wherefore to conclude, Let all good Subjects, conſidering how horrible a Sin againſt God, their Prince, their Country, their Country-men, againſt all God's and Man's Laws,</hi> Rebellion <hi>is; being indeed not one ſeveral Sin, but all Sins againſt God and Man heaped together; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſchievous Life and Deeds, and the ſhameful Ends and Deaths of all</hi> Rebels <hi>hitherto; and the pitiful undoing of their Wives, Children, and Families, and disinheriting of their Heirs for ever; and, above all things, conſidering the</hi> Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>that is prepared for all impenitent</hi> Rebels <hi>in</hi> Hell, <hi>with</hi> Satan <hi>the</hi> firſt Founder <hi>of</hi> Rebellion, <hi>and</hi> Grand Captain <hi>of all</hi> Rebels; <hi>Let all good Subjects (I ſay) conſidering theſe Things, avoid and flee</hi> all Rebellion <hi>as the greateſt of all Miſchiefs: And,</hi> as the fifth Homily ends, <hi>knowing theſe the ſpecial</hi> Inſtruments <hi>and</hi> Miniſters <hi>of the</hi> Devil, <hi>to the ſtirring up of all</hi> Rebellions, <hi>avoid and flee them, and the Peſtilent Suggeſtions of ſuch</hi> Foreign Uſurpers, <hi>and their Adherents, and embrace all obedience to God, and their</hi> Natural <hi>Princes, and Sovereigns,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Words of our <hi>Homilies,</hi> which have much more to the ſame purpoſe. But I am afraid I have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed upon your Patience in repeating ſo much of them:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59238:43"/>But I was in more than ordinary concern to ſee our Author ſo gravely vouch the <hi>Homilies</hi> on his ſide, which might paſs with thoſe who have not conſulted them; therefore forgive my inſiſting ſo long upon them, and I will not trouble you to apply all this to his Hypotheſis. I ſhould reckon it an Affront to your Underſtanding to attempt it. Only, I pray, keep this with you, That you know what ſtreſs to lay upon this Author's <hi>Confident Vouching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are now come to our Author's leſſer Quotations, which might be ſpar'd; for after examining what he offers from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> from the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and <hi>Publick Acts</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and from our <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Laws,</hi> what <hi>Private Writer</hi> can have Authority to over-ballance all theſe?</p>
            <p>But, if even thoſe very Authors he quotes either make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, or make directly againſt him; then we muſt ſuppoſe, That he thought his Cauſe very deſtitute, when he could find no more to ſay for it.<note place="margin">From <hi>Grotius.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, The Caſe which <hi>Gratius</hi> cites out of <hi>Barclay,</hi> is, <hi>Si Rex vere Hoſtili animo,</hi> If a King really with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oſtile Mind,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59238:44"/>that is, as an <hi>open Enemy, in totius Populi exitium feratur,</hi> do attempt the Deſtruction of his <hi>whole</hi> People. — Now our Author, to bring this Caſe nearer to his Deſign, and to paſs upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Readers, inſtead of a <hi>truly hoſtile Mind,</hi> which is being a <hi>perfect Enemy,</hi> words it only, the King <hi>having Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in his Mind, a malicious Deſign;</hi> which may be eaſier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and infer'd from a hundred things, than an <hi>open, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> Attempt to cut off <hi>a whole Nation,</hi> if it be not true; for Peoples Eyes will undeceive them in that.</p>
            <p>But what would our Author make of this? a King's Deſign to deſtroy the <hi>whole</hi> People? <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays, in the above-quoted place, <hi>That it is hardly poſſible to enter into the heart of a King who is not mad</hi> And our Author does not ſo much as pretend it againſt King <hi>James,</hi> but only that he deſign'd to deſtroy <hi>the Protestant</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore we muſt come to the other part of what <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays; <hi>viz. That if a King Govern many People, it may happen that in favour of one People he may deſire the other were destroy'd.</hi> Thus our Author. — But <hi>Grotius</hi> gives his Reaſon in the Words which our Author conceals; viz. <hi>Ut Colonias ibi faciat,</hi> which governs what he ſaid before; <hi>viz.</hi> That a King may deſign to root out a People <hi>where he intends to make a Colony:</hi> That is, ſo far as to make room for his <hi>Colony,</hi> as it is with our Plantations in <hi>Ireland</hi> and in <hi>America,</hi> which no Man will ſtretch farther than to bring the Natives <hi>under Subjection,</hi> not to <hi>deſtroy them all.</hi> And take notice, that theſe Words <hi>Ut Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonias ibi faciat,</hi> are all the Words which remain of that Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Author has quoted; viz. <hi>De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> lib. 1. cap. 4. §. 11. Our Author has repeated every Word of that Section, except theſe four Words, which do conclude it, and ſhew plainly <hi>Grotius</hi>'s meaning to be quite different from what our Author would have us believe; why otherwiſe he ſhould be at the pains of Tranſcribing that Section, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it <hi>verbatim</hi> in his Margin, and omit only the four laſt Words, he will give us a Reaſon in his next.</p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>Grotius</hi> conſents to <hi>Barclay</hi> in that Caſe of a King's deſigning to deſtroy his <hi>Whole</hi> People, that he, thereby, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Government of them; becauſe, as he rightly infers, a Will to <hi>Govern</hi> and to <hi>Deſtroy</hi> cannot conſiſt together: but he does not ſay that a King may not deſtroy <hi>a part,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59238:44"/>
               <hi>another Part;</hi> or that if he does, he does thereby <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> the Government of thoſe whom he ſo ſeeks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. There is no ſuch thing in <hi>Grotius,</hi> and there is nothing elſe would have been to this Author's purpoſe. Remember the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Thing we were upon before, we are now only upon the <hi>Quotations.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> in this Quotation, as ſet down by our Author, puts the Caſe not only of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's <hi>Deſign</hi> to Deſtroy his People, but that he <hi>Profeſſes</hi> himſelf an <hi>Enemy</hi> to his <hi>whole</hi> People: And this is the Act which <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays ſuppoſes him to be <hi>mad,</hi> and to abdicate his Kingdom, which will no ways ſerve our Author's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs he prove that King <hi>James</hi> did not only <hi>deſign,</hi> but <hi>profeſs</hi> himſelf an <hi>Enemy</hi> to his People; nor can you make him <hi>Abdicate</hi> by this Quotation, unleſs you make him to be <hi>mad</hi> at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>But I have ſaid enough as to <hi>Grotius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">From <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi>
               </note> the next <hi>Authority</hi> he produces is Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> who, this Author ſays, in his Vindication of Chriſt's reprehending St. <hi>Peter</hi> from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> approves this Paſſage of <hi>Grotius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo he might, without making any Thing for this Author's purpoſe, as I have ſhewn; but how does Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> approve it? Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays, That <hi>Grotius mentions ſome Caſes wherein a King may be Reſiſted, as in Caſe a King ſhall Abdicate his Kingdom, and manifeſtly Relinquiſh his Power, then he turns Private Man, and may be dealt with as any other ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſays, That <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaid ſo, but does <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> approve of it? No, not in that place, but he brings it as an Objection of his Adverſaries, which they Quoted out of <hi>Grotius</hi> againſt him; and he thought it made ſo little againſt him, that he ſaid they would <hi>find little Joy in it,</hi> and other their like Quotations our of <hi>Grotius,</hi> whom the Doctor in the ſame place ſtrongly vindicates. And indeed what Joy could Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> find in that Saying of <hi>Grotius,</hi> to ſerve their Principle of <hi>Reſiſtance?</hi> For if a King ſhould <hi>voluntarily</hi> and <hi>manifeſtly Relinquiſh</hi> his Power, and <hi>Abdicate</hi> his Kingdom, and becomes thereby a <hi>Private Man,</hi> and though he may <hi>then</hi> be Reſiſted, Will it follow that a <hi>King</hi> may be Reſiſted? That would make this ſort of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe a <hi>Private Man</hi> may be Reſiſted, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59238:45"/>a <hi>King</hi> may be Reſiſted; and as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaid, I wiſh our Author Joy of this Quotation.</p>
            <p>But pray tell me, if you can imagine, what it was could poſſeſs our Author to appeal to Dr. <hi>Hammond?</hi> Will he abide by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Judgment in this Cauſe? No, certainly he will not; he writes in flat oppoſition to him. What then? Did he think to pick up ſome odd ſcrap out of him to give credit to his Cauſe, by naming Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on its ſide? Whereas every one that reads him muſt ſee that he runs dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to the Principles for which he is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Nay, in the very Paragraph which this Author quotes, Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> is vindicating <hi>Grorius</hi>'s Principles for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>neither Publick nor Private Perſons may lawfully wage War against them under whoſe Command they are;</hi> and <hi>That it was the greatest injury that could be done to the Ancient Chriſtians, to ſay, That it was want of Strength, not of Inclination that way, that they defended not themſelves in time of most certain danger of Death:</hi> and much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

He is now one of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived Clergy</hi> of this Kingdom, for his conſtant adhering to his old <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> Yet this Author will needs quote him on his ſide, and would have the Reader believe that he is againſt <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> even in that Book which he wrote purpoſely in its defence: Some of which you have already heard quoted.</p>
            <p>Well! let him be produced; we will hear what he ſays in this Cauſe. Firſt, our Author ſtates the Queſtion, <hi>Suppoſe a King endeavours to deſtroy his People;</hi> by which we muſt mean the <hi>whole People,</hi> as already ſhewn out of <hi>Grotius;</hi> otherwiſe if this Author would have it meant only of <hi>a part</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he ſhould tell us <hi>what part,</hi> and how circumſtantiated, that we might know his meaning. But <hi>Dolus latet in Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> In which this Author has indeed an excellent faculty; for it is harder to know where to have him, than to confute him.</p>
            <p>But to the Caſe in hand: <hi>Jovian</hi> ſays, That to <hi>ſuppoſe this, is plainly to ſuppoſe the utmost Impoſſibility.</hi> But ſuppoſing it, then our Author quotes him again, ſaying, that in ſuch a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59238:45"/>Caſe, <hi>his good Subjects would deſert him.</hi> By which he means no more, as he there explains himſelf, than <hi>not Aſſiſting</hi> him in ſuch wicked Deſigns, which certainly would be the part of a good Subject. But what is this to <hi>Depoſing, Abdicating, taking Arms againſt him, and putting another in his place?</hi> But he goes on with <hi>Jovian,</hi> and quotes p. 152. where he ſays, <hi>He ſhould be tempted to pray for the Deſtruction of ſuch a Prince.</hi> What Ground or Reaſon does <hi>Jovian</hi> give for this? He ſays in the Words immediately before, (which our Author forgot to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> down) that all this was upon the Suppoſition of ſuch a Prince as <hi>Julian,</hi> who had ſinned againſt a Series of Divine Miracles, and diſcovered a Diabolical Malice againſt Chriſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> breach of Charity might be ſuppoſed upon Scripture Principles to have <hi>ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and become incapable of Repentance. <hi>And upon that Suppoſition,</hi> ſays <hi>Jovian, I ſhould be tempted to pray for his Deſtruction, as the only means of delivering the Church.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> knew no other way of Deliverance for the Church in the Time of Perſecution but what came from God, that is, either God's <hi>Converting</hi> or <hi>Removing</hi> the Perſecutor who was our Lawful Governour. Now if you will ſuppoſe him inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Repentance, it is a <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> indeed, which we have no certain means of knowing; but <hi>ſuppoſing it,</hi> as old <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> probably did in the Caſe of <hi>Julian,</hi> then there is no other way but his Deſtruction; and whether we ſhould Pray, even for that, is a Queſtion which Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> does not determine, unleſs it be in the Negative: He ſays, he ſhould be <hi>Tempted</hi> to pray ſo. Now whether does this Argue that Praying ſo was a <hi>Duty</hi> or a <hi>Sin?</hi> We are ſaid to be <hi>Tempted</hi> to <hi>Sin,</hi> not to our <hi>Duty.</hi> Lead us not into <hi>Temptation,</hi> does not mean, Lead us not to our <hi>Duty.</hi> God <hi>tempteth</hi> no man, but every Man is <hi>tempted when he is drawn away of his own Luſts,</hi>

               </gap>y, that Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> by this Expreſſion was poſitive in its being our <hi>Duty</hi> to pray to: But this he was Poſitive in, <hi>viz.</hi> That you muſt do no more than Pray. Theſe are his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59238:46"/>Words, which follow thoſe this Author has Quoted. <hi>I muſt alſo declare,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that I would do nothing but pray againſt him. I would draw fourth no Squadrons againſt him, but ſuch as old</hi> Gregory <hi>did againſt</hi> Julian, <hi>Squadrons of Prayers and Tears. I would Dye rather than Reſiſt him, or thoſe that were put in Authority under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would gladly know, What it was which tempted this Author to leave out theſe Words of Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi>'s, which would have abundantly ſhewn his Principle in this Matter, to every the meaneſt Reader: We muſt conclude that our Author did not intend it, But to amuſe them with the firſt part to miſtake the <hi>Doctor,</hi> as if he had been for <hi>Reſiſtance.</hi> But his <hi>Practice</hi> is ſuch an undeniable Comment upon his <hi>Writings,</hi> That this Author could not have light upon a way to expoſe both himſelf and his Book more effectually than by Quoting Dr. <hi>Hicks</hi> as one whoſe Opinion he follows.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">From <hi>Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
               </note>The laſt Quotation he brings is from <hi>Faulkner</hi>'s <hi>Chriſtian Loyalty,</hi> B. 2. c. 5. n. 19, 20. Let us hear the Words he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces. They are theſe, <hi>viz. But if ever any ſuch ſtrange Caſe as is ſuppoſed ſhould really happen, I confeſs it would have its great Difficulties.</hi> Who ever doubted it? I cannot imagine what he brought this for. I ſuppoſe all the meaning was to ſhew, That the Paſſive-Obedience-Men would not have ſuch Caſes to be put. And can you blame them? <hi>Diſloyal</hi> and <hi>Seditious</hi> Spirits, to ſtir Men up to Rebellion, do make Caſes that never were in the World. And it is next to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ever they ſhould be; as a King going about to Deſtroy <hi>All his whole People,</hi> or <hi>Half,</hi> or a <hi>Quarter</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Who would endure it, if any Man ſhould publiſh ſuch Caſes of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> as ſuppoſe an Act of Parliament were made to Hang every Man at his Door, to Sell the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>French,</hi> to Maſſacre the <hi>Whole,</hi> or <hi>Half,</hi> or <hi>Quarter</hi> of the People. If any Man ſhould raiſe ſuch Suggeſtions of the <hi>States in Holland,</hi> and deſire to know what the People were to do in ſuch Caſes, I ſuppoſe there is no Government but would ſtop his Mouth, without being at the Pains of ſatisfying his Curioſity. Yet this Author is very Angry that the Non-Reſiſtance-Men ſhould deſire ſuch Caſes not to be put. Hear Dr. <hi>Faulkner</hi>'s own Words, which our Author
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59238:46"/>thinks do him ſo great ſervice. <hi>But in truth the Caſe above-mentioned ought not at all to be ſuppoſed, or taken into Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; for there is greater hurt to be feared from the making ſuch Suppoſitions, than from the Things ſuppoſed; ſince it is much more likely that ſuch Deſigns ſhould be imagin'd, and believ'd to be true, when they are falſe, (as they were in the unjuſt</hi> Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys, <hi>againſt our late Gracious Sovereign</hi>) <hi>than that they ſhould be certainly true. And every Good Man, yea every Reaſonable Man, may have as great Confidence that no ſuch Caſe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happen, as can be had concerning the future ſtate of any thing in this World.</hi> Thus Dr. <hi>Faulkner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author may perhaps ſay, That all this is made out in his Book concerning K. <hi>James;</hi> but that is begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. And this I may ſay, I am ſure without offence, That this Author will never make any Man believe that K. <hi>James</hi> did deſign the <hi>Extirpation</hi> or <hi>Maſſacre</hi> either of the <hi>whole</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>half,</hi> or <hi>quarter</hi> of them. He had them all (except two ſmall Towns) in his mercy for a whole Summer, and did not kill a Man of them; though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved (and it proved true) that their Hearts were againſt him, and would Joyn with his Enemies when ever they could (of which their daily Deſerting him, and giving Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to the Enemy was a Demonſtration) yet he preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from being deſtroyed, and took pains to hinder thoſe who were ready enough to have done it.</p>
            <p>I will not deny out that he might deſire to put the Sword in the hands of thoſe of his own Religion, and to make them the Ballance of the Nation, which was natural enough for him to wiſh; yet I do not Juſtify it. But that ever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to <hi>Maſſacre</hi> or <hi>Extirpate</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I confeſs I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe. And his Carriage in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by all the Accounts I could have of it, nay take it altogether, even as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells it, is a Demonſtration to the contrary. But I am too long upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>Let us return to our Author's Quotation. And here I muſt tell him, That though <hi>Faulkner</hi> is againſt having ſuch Caſes put, as aboveſaid, yet it is not that an Anſwer cannot be given; for he gives it out of Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> in the very ſame Place which our Author Quotes, but he takes care
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59238:47"/>to conceal the Words, which if he had ſet down, it would have appeared very ridiculous to have ſaid, as he does, that Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſeems to allow the Doctrine of <hi>Reſiſtance.</hi> The Biſhop's Words are theſe as quoted by <hi>Faulkner,</hi> firſt finding fault with ſuch Caſes being put, That <hi>they are able,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to ſet Grave and Good Men at their wits end.</hi> But then he adds, <hi>yet we ſtand not on that,</hi> and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively determines in theſe words, which I had occaſion part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Quote before: <hi>If the Laws of the Land where they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, do not permit them to ſave their Lives, when they are aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with unjuſt force againſt Law, or if they take Arms, as you do, to depoſe Princes, we will never excuſe them from Rebellion.</hi> Thus <hi>Bilſon.</hi> And the very firſt words of the Chapter which our Authour quotes of <hi>Faulkner, viz.</hi> Book 2. c. 5. puts the Caſe as directly againſt our Authors Poſition, as if he had read our Author's Book, and wrote on purpoſe to confute it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There have been ſome,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who grant the unlawfulneſs of taking Arms againſt a Soveraign Prince, to be a</hi> General <hi>Rule for</hi> ordinary <hi>Circumſtances; but yet they pretend there are ſome</hi> Great <hi>and</hi> Extraordinary <hi>Caſes in which it muſt admit of</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: <hi>And the propoſal of theſe Caſes as they are by them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged is like the</hi> Phariſaical Corban, <hi>an Engine and Method to make void the Duties of the Fifth Commandment</hi> — And then he goes on, and undertakes in this Chap. the defence of that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Barckley,</hi> who propoſeth the Queſtion, <hi>Nulli nè Caſus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>May there no Caſes fall out in which the People by their Authority may take Arms againſt their King?</hi> And his Anſwer is, <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none; ſo long as he is King, or unleſs</hi> ipſo jure Rex eſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinat.</p>
            <p>This is the ſame he Quoted Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> for before. <hi>viz.</hi> that the Perſon who was King may be Reſiſted, when he does <hi>voluntarily</hi> Relinquiſh his Power and becomes a private Perſon, for then indeed <hi>ipſo jure</hi> he of Right ceaſes to be a King.</p>
            <p>But may be our Author will ſay that <hi>ipſo jure</hi> and <hi>ipſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi>

               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59238:47"/>But it brings into my mind an Anſwer a <hi>Scots</hi> Presbyterian Miniſter (whoſe Principles as to Government our Author has but licked up) gave to the Objection in the 23 Chapter of their Confeſſion of Faith upon the Head of the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</hi> viz. <hi>That Infidelity, or Difference in Religion, does not take away a King's Right to his Crown, nor abſolve his Subjects from their Allegiance to him.</hi> The Miniſter replied, That is true; for if a King turn Infidel, he does <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ceaſe to be a King: So that our Author was not the <hi>Original</hi> of this <hi>pretty Diſtinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faulkner,</hi> in the ſame place, ſhews our Author's Doctrine to be borrow'd from <hi>Mariana, Bellermine,</hi> and other, <hi>Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cal</hi> Doctors. (<hi>Jeſuit</hi> and <hi>Puritan</hi> are convertible Terms, in the Point of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> only that the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> is the Elder Brother) and determins againſt them, N. 3. <hi>That the Agreement of the Whole body of the People, or the Chief and Greater part thereof, can give no ſufficient Authority to ſuch an Enterpriſe, viz.</hi> of taking Arms againſt the King. And with reſpect to this Kingdom, he quotes our Laws, which declare it Unlawful for the two Houſes of Parliament, though Jointly, to take Arms againſt the King — <hi>Faulkner</hi> goes on, and proves as directly againſt our Author, in this ſame Chapter which our Author quotes on his ſide, as Words can be fram'd. But there are none ſo blind as they that will not ſee.</p>
            <p>Theſe are all the <hi>Quotations</hi> he brings to ſupport his new Hypotheſis, and how far they ſerve to his purpoſe, I leave it to the Reader; and from the whole, I ſhall only mind our Author of the Inſtances I have already given him, <hi>viz.</hi> The Condition of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> under <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus,</hi> and the <hi>Romans:</hi> The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> under <hi>Saul,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> more eſpecially in the laſt Decennial Perſecution.

            <p>But let us proceed.

               <note place="margin">The <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> related by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note>We will go now to conſider his <hi>Matters of Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Errors in <hi>Judgment</hi> may befall good Men, but any wilful Miſtake in <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> is paſt all Excuſe, and is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to an honeſt Intention; eſpecially where we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, before God, as this A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>thor does, pag 239. That we have not <hi>aggravated</hi> nor <hi>miſrepreſented</hi> any thing againſt our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon this Diſquiſition I deſire to obviate an Objection I know will be made, as if I were about wholly to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59238:48"/>vindicate all that the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> and other of K. <hi>J</hi>'s Miniſters have done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpecially before this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution began, and which moſt of any thing brought it on. No, I am far from it: I am ſenſible that their Carriage in many particulars gave greater occaſion to K. <hi>J</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, than all the other Male-Adminiſtrations which were charged upon his Government.</p>
            <p>But after K. <hi>J.</hi> came in Perſon into <hi>Ireland,</hi> there was no Act, which could properly be called his, that was not all Mercy and Goodneſs to the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and as many of them as do retain the leaſt ſenſe of Gratitude, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege it: Of which you will ſee ſeveral Inſtances, in clearing the Matters of Fact which this Author Produces.</p>
            <p>And I muſt do that Juſtice, even to the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> that I have heard ſeveral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtants ſay, That the Objections they had againſt him were for his Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them before the beginning of this Revolution; but that afterwards he manag'd with Moderation and Prudence, and more Favour to the Proteſtants than they expected: And that he was againſt repealing the <hi>Acts of Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot ſay I have examined into every ſingle Matter of Fact which this Author relates; I could not have the Opportunity: But I am ſure I have the moſt material; and by theſe you will eaſily judge of his Sincerity in the reſt, which could not all come to my Knowlege. But this I can ſay, That there is not one I have enquired into, but I have found it falſe, <hi>in whole,</hi> or <hi>in part, aggravated</hi> or <hi>miſrepreſented,</hi> ſo as to alter the whole face of the Story, and give it perfectly another Air and Turn. Inſomuch that though many things he ſays are true, yet he has hardly ſpoke a true Word, that is, told it truly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, without a Warp.</p>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59238:49"/>the Kingdom,</hi> (of <hi>Ireland</hi>) <hi>that they would not be the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, and that they held ſtedfaſtly to their Reſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, in the ſame <hi>Sect. n.</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 104. he tells of thoſe who did not keep to that Reſolution, and that by way of an Excuſe. He pleads in behalf of theſe Proteſtants, <hi>That the Shutting up of</hi> Derry <hi>againſt the Earl of</hi> Antrim's <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was all that was done by any</hi> Proteſtant <hi>in</hi> Ireland <hi>in Oppoſition to the Government, till K.</hi> J. <hi>deſerted</hi> England, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what was done at</hi> Eneskillen, <hi>where they refuſed to Quarter two Companies ſent to them by the Lord Deputy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was modeſtly worded; for they not only refuſed to quarter them, but marched out in Arms againſt them, to the number of 200 Foot and 150 Horſe, and drove them away before they came near the Town; as we are told by Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> in his <hi>Actions of the</hi> Eneskillen-men, <hi>p.</hi> 3. who was himſelf one of them, and then preſent in the Action.</p>
            <p>But what does he mean by ſaying, <hi>That this was all that was done by the</hi> Proteſtants; was not this enough? To ſeize the King's Forts, to Enliſt and Array Soldiers, and march in Arms againſt the King's Forces? Did our Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect what Conſtruction the Law puts upon all this?</p>
            <p>Was this keeping ſtedfaſtly to their Reſolution of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Aggreſſors?</hi> Was this the <hi>ſo deep a Senſe of Loyalty, and mighty Veneration to the very Name of</hi> Authority, <hi>which made them abhor any thing that lookt like an Inſurrection againſt the Government,</hi> as this Author juſt before, in the ſame <hi>Sect. n.</hi> 2. expreſſes it? And yet he confeſſes that this was acting <hi>in Oppoſition to the Government:</hi> For he ſays, That this was all that was done by any Proteſtant <hi>in Oppoſition to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> till K. <hi>J.</hi> deſerted <hi>England;</hi> and yet, as above, That ALL the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> held ſtedfaſtly to their Reſolution of not being the <hi>Aggreſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he propoſes ſome Advantage, by adding this Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, That this was all done <hi>before K.</hi> J. <hi>deſerted</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Here he would bring in the Point of <hi>Abdication,</hi> which he by this ſuppoſes did commence upon K. <hi>J</hi>'s going out of <hi>England;</hi> and thereby he would juſtifie all that was done after that time in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He has by this yielded the Cauſe againſt himſelf; for he confeſſes that <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Eneskillen</hi> had oppoſed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59238:49"/>in Arms <hi>before that time;</hi> and I will ſhew you by and by many more Inſtances beſides thoſe of <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Eneskillen.</hi>

               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Author will not venture, for theſe Reaſons, to limit K. <hi>J</hi>'s <hi>Abdication</hi> to his leaving <hi>England;</hi> for, as I have quoted him before, p. 14. he avers, That K. <hi>J.</hi> by <hi>endeavouring to deſtroy us, in that very Act did Abdicate.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I will not repeat what I have ſaid before upon that Point of <hi>Abdication;</hi> That, even in the Senſe this Author and ſome others take it, it ought to be declared (by their own Principles) in ſome <hi>Convention, Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Judicial manner,</hi> before private Men can lawfully act upon it.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Abdication</hi> was not determined in the <hi>Convention</hi> till <hi>February</hi> 1688. long before which time the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were in Arms.</p>
            <p>But take it, as this Author here puts it, to refer to the time of K. <hi>J</hi>'s going out of <hi>England:</hi> His firſt leaving <hi>Whitehall,</hi> when he went to <hi>Feverſham,</hi> was the 11th of <hi>Dec.</hi> 88. but he came back to <hi>London,</hi> and did not go out of <hi>England</hi> till <hi>Dec.</hi> 23. 88.</p>
            <p>And it was a good while after, before they knew of it in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This therefore can be no excuſe for what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> had done long before.</p>
            <p>But to come home to our Authors Aſſertion; Was there <hi>nothing done by any Proteſtant in</hi> Ireland, <hi>in oppoſition to the Government, till K.</hi> J. <hi>deſerted</hi> England, <hi>except that of</hi> Derry <hi>and</hi> Eneskillen?</p>
            <p>I am told by perſons, who ſay they were Eye-witneſſes, That long before K. <hi>J.</hi> left <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were generally all in Arms, appointed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Officers; <hi>Inliſted</hi> Men; <hi>Arm'd</hi> and <hi>Array'd</hi> them; they <hi>Regimented</hi> themſelves, and had frequent <hi>Rendevouzes;</hi> they appear'd in the Field with <hi>Drums beating</hi> and <hi>Colours flying;</hi> they choſe <hi>Governors of Counties,</hi> and appointed <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Committees</hi> to carry on their Buſineſs; they Diſarmed the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and ſuch of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as they ſuſpected not to be Cordial to their Cauſe: I need not mind you, that all this was not only without any Authority from the King, but that it was not ſo much as pretended; on the contrary, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> appears by what they did after, and boaſt of here as their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59238:50"/>Merit, that all this was intended, at leaſt by many of them, in direct Oppoſition to the King.</p>
            <p>You cannot imagine, that they could <hi>in a moment</hi> march out Horſe and Foot in good Order, and all Officer'd, as they did at <hi>Eneskillen</hi> againſt thoſe two <hi>Companies</hi> that were ſent to quarter there. It is therefore certain, that <hi>ſometime before this</hi> they had Marſhall'd themſelves, Inliſted their Men, choſen their Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was <hi>Treaſon</hi> by the Law, tho they had not entred upon Action; and I believe no Man in the World, but our Author, will deny this to be <hi>in Oppoſition to the Government:</hi> What Government would not think it ſo? Therefore the ſhutting up of <hi>Derry</hi> Gates againſt the E of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment, and <hi>Eneskillen</hi> refuſing to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two Companies ſent to them by the Lord Deputy, <hi>was not all that was done by any Proteſtant in</hi> Ireland, <hi>in oppoſition to the Government, till K.</hi> J. <hi>deſerted</hi> England, as our Author words it. Their former <hi>Preparations</hi> in order to that Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they then made, was as much Treaſon in the eye of the Law, tho not ſo great Treaſon, as the Reſiſtance it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But when did they begin to make theſe Preparations? We are told in one of the Accounts, Printed by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, intituled, <hi>A faithful Hiſtory of the Northern Affairs of</hi> Ireland, <hi>from the late K.</hi> James'<hi>s Acceſſion to the Crown, to the Siege of</hi> London-Derry; <hi>by a Perſon who bore a great ſhare in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe Tranſactions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are told in this Account, <hi>p.</hi> 7. That they began to <hi>Arm,</hi> and to engage themſelves in <hi>Aſſociations,</hi> about <hi>Sept.</hi> 88. (before thoſe <hi>written Aſſociations</hi> which were afterwards publiſhed.) In the Proſecution of which Affair, the Lord <hi>B.</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Monaghan,</hi> and Sir <hi>A. R.</hi> in <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Antrim</hi> appeared moſt forward. This was when the report grew hot of the P. of O's deſign'd Expedition into <hi>England;</hi> they then, as that Author ſays, p. 6. <hi>did preſume too far upon the Opinion of their own ſtrength, and finding the Affairs of</hi> England <hi>run ſucceſsfully on the Proteſtants ſide, raſhly fancy'd themſelves able enough to attempt their Deliverance.</hi> I am the rather inclin'd to believe him, not only becauſe he ſays, that himſelf bore a great ſhare in thoſe Tranſactions, but I find him ſo far from being a Friend to K. <hi>James,</hi> or writing on his ſide, that he dips his Pen in Gall againſt him, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59238:50"/>repreſents him even with Virulence; and he writes on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to vindicate their Proceedings in the <hi>North,</hi> of which himſelf, he ſays, bore a great ſhare, and therefore not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak with any Deſign to Prejudice their Cauſe; and he tells us quite contrary to our preſent Author; That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> began very early, two Months before the P. of <hi>O.</hi> Landed here, and were from that time gathering ſtrength, <hi>Arming, Marſhalling</hi> and <hi>Training</hi> their Men to the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and the uſe of their <hi>Arms</hi> (in which I am told they were very diligent) till at length they were able to make that firſt oppoſition which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſpeaks of at <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Eneskillen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was before the P. of O. came into <hi>England,</hi> and I find a little after, <hi>viz.</hi> about the end of <hi>Novemb.</hi> 88. <hi>When the happy tydings of the P. of</hi> O. <hi>Landing had reached our Ears in</hi> Ireland (<hi>ſays Mr.</hi> J.

               <hi>Accordingly on</hi> Dec <hi>the</hi> 8th. <hi>they ſent over a Gentleman, now in Town</hi> (ſays the Book) <hi>who in purſuance of theſe Inſtructions delivered in a memorial enlarging on theſe heads (for they begg'd no particular favour for a Party) to the then P. of</hi> O. <hi>the Originals of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59238:51"/>both which Papers are in my hands,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Boyſe,</hi> whoſe Words theſe are.</p>
            <p>Now I muſt inform you that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are much the moſt numerous Party of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ulſter,</hi> which is that is called the <hi>North of Ireland;</hi> ſome Pariſhes have not <hi>ten,</hi> not <hi>ſix</hi> that come to Church. While the <hi>Presbyterian Meetings</hi> are crowded with <hi>thouſands</hi> covering all the Fields; this is ordinary in the County of <hi>Antrim</hi> eſpecially, which is the moſt populous of <hi>Scots,</hi> of any in <hi>Ulſter,</hi> (who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in that Country) in other of the <hi>Northern</hi> Counties the <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtants</hi> bear a greater Proportion; ſome more, ſome leſs: But upon the whole, as I have it from thoſe that live upon the Place, they are not <hi>One</hi> to <hi>Fifty,</hi> nor ſo much, but they would ſpeak within Compaſs.</p>
            <p>From hence we may conclude, That the aboveſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the P. of O. may be ſaid to be the Addreſs of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> eſpecially conſidering that none of the others did Diſcent from it, I ſuppoſe many Joyn'd in it, for the Conteſt then was, who ſhould be moſt forward in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Affection to the Cauſe; and who could firſt meet <hi>his Highneſs,</hi> thought they had moſt title to his favour.</p>
            <p>And this our Author knows was before King <hi>James</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted <hi>England;</hi> and I ſuppoſe he will not have the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſay, That this was nothing done <hi>in oppoſition to the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will give one Inſtance more. We have heard, and this Author could not but know, of the great Alarm of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Maſſacre of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the Ninth day of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1688. The whole of this aroſe from a Letter ſaid to be found in <hi>Cumber-ſtreet,</hi> which was carried to the Earl of <hi>M.</hi> diſcovering the ſaid Maſſacre intended: The fooliſh but artificial Alarm of the few Disbanded <hi>Iriſh</hi> cutting all our Throats in <hi>England</hi> did not fly more Incredibly, to be in all Parts of <hi>England</hi> on the ſelf ſame Night, than this of the Letter found at <hi>Cumber</hi> flew through <hi>Ireland,</hi> and wrought Prodigious Effects upon a People fitted for ſuch an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. When this News arrived in <hi>Dublin</hi> (as the <hi>faithful Hiſtory</hi> before quoted tells us, pag. 8.) <hi>It ſo alarm'd the City, that above</hi> 5000 <hi>Proteſtants appeared in Arms, that ſame night; and many Hundred Families embarqued from all Parts
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59238:51"/>in ſuch confuſion, that they left every thing but their Lives behind them, and yet all this,</hi> as this Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>he is very well aſſured was only a contrivance deviſed, as the readieſt means to engage the E. of</hi> M. (<hi>who till then was deaf to all arguments for entring into their Aſſociation</hi>) <hi>and to animate a dejected People, who of themſelves were backward to all Arguments of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Thus the Hiſtorian and that Letter did attain its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired end, for not only the ſaid E. of <hi>M.</hi> did heartily engage, and after took upon him to be <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Aſſociation</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> but the generality of the People, as if all ſet on fire at one, How to their Arms as readily as they could be commanded, ſo that the whole <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> appeared on the ſudden all in one Blaze, all in Arms, all Marching up and down, and all in confuſion, as themſelves give the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>It was this made <hi>Derry</hi> ſhut their Gates, and was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all the confuſion that followed. The Man they firſt pitcht upon for their General was the E. of <hi>Granard,</hi> who was upon all accompts more competent for that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than any amongſt the <hi>Aſſociators.</hi> Purſuant to this Reſolution, Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Tollimore</hi> went to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to his Lordſhip the number and poſture of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> and to invite his Lordſhip to put himſelf upon the Head of their Troops. But that Noble Lord would not ſuffer himſelf to be perſwaded by the ſeeming Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of appearing ſo early, and in ſo conſiderable a Poſt for the P. of <hi>O.</hi> wherein he might by all humane reckoning, have turn'd the Ballance of that Kingdom; For he wiſely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that tho the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> were numerous and arm'd, and of Reſolution and Courage to exceſs, yet they were Undiciplin'd, all Voluntiers, and conſequently not Party for a form'd Army; he told Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that he did not know what it was to command a <hi>Rabble.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that he had lived <hi>Loyal</hi> all his Life, and would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it in his old age; and he was reſolved, <hi>That no Man ſhould write Rebell upon his Graveſtone,</hi> this was his very expreſſion, and he purſu'd it, for he not only refuſed to Command the Aſſociators in the <hi>North,</hi> but perſuaded them to leave off their mad Enterpriſe, told them they would be ruin'd, as it came to paſs, and Sign'd ſeveral Proclamations,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59238:52"/>declaring them <hi>Rebels,</hi> and ſummoning them to lay down their Arms.</p>
            <p>Now this Alarme of the intended Maſſacre, and Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi>'s Invitation to the E of <hi>Granard</hi> to Command the Army of the <hi>Northern Aſſociation,</hi> was in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> 88. about the 6th. or 7th. and therefore before K. <hi>James</hi> left <hi>England,</hi> and before the ſhutting up of <hi>Derry</hi> againſt the E. of <hi>Antrims</hi> Regiment, and before <hi>Eneskillen</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to quarter the two Companies ſent to them by the Lord Deputy, which was the 16th. of <hi>December</hi> 88. as you will ſee in <hi>Hamiltons actions of the Eneskillen Men,</hi> p. 3.</p>
            <p>So much has the Authors Information fail'd him, when he avers, without any heſitation, That the ſhutting up of <hi>Derry</hi> Gates, and this of <hi>Eneskillen,</hi> as avoveſaid, <hi>was all that was done by any Proteſtant in</hi> Ireland, <hi>in oppoſition to the Government, till King</hi> James <hi>deſerted</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Though, as I have ſhown before, it would not have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much to the uſe for which our Author brought it, if it had been done after the King went away, or any time before the <hi>Convention</hi> declared his <hi>Receſs</hi> to be an <hi>Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now here is a more material Thing coming; and that is, The Deſcent of King <hi>James</hi>'s Army into the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1688.</p>
            <p>Our Author would make us believe, That it was wholly Cauſeleſs, as to any Provocation given by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but that it was only a Deſign of my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s, <hi>to involve the Kingdom in Blood, and that therefore he made all the haſte he could to ſend down that Army, and that no Perſwaſions would prevail upon him to defer fending it till the King ſhould come, leſt there ſhould be any Terms propoſed or accepted by the People in the North, and ſo that Country eſcape being Plundered and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is in his num. 10. § 8. of ch. 3. p. 106 which has this Title in the Heads of his Diſcoure, <hi>viz. Lord</hi> Tyrconnel <hi>haſtned to run them into Blood before King</hi> James's <hi>Coming.</hi> In the num. before, p. 104, 105. he tells us, there was no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or not Sufficient, given for the Deſcent of that Army; and here, p. 106. what was the true Cauſe of it. We will Examine both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59238:52"/>For the firſt, he aſſerts, p. 105. <hi>They</hi> (the Proteſtants) <hi>were not ſo much as ſummoned by him</hi> (the Lord Deputy.) This ſhows the unreaſonable haſte and precipitancy of the Lord Deputy, To ſend an Army, and enter into Blood, without ſo much as <hi>ſummoning</hi> the offending Party. But our Author goes on, <hi>Nor did they</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Proteſtants) <hi>enter into any act of</hi> Hoſtility, <hi>or</hi> Aſſociation, <hi>or</hi> offend <hi>any</hi> till aſſaulted. <hi>But finding that continual Robberies and Plunderings were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch as the Lord Deputy</hi>—<hi>had intruſted with Arms and Employments</hi>— <hi>The Gentlemen in the</hi> North, <hi>to prevent their own Ruin, entered into</hi> Aſſociations, <hi>to defend themſelves from theſe</hi> Robbers; <hi>their Aſſociations did really reach</hi> no farther than this; <hi>nor did they Attempt any thing upon the</hi> Armed Robbers, <hi>except in their own Defence, when Invaded and Aſſaulted by them: Inſomuch that I could never hear of one act of Hoſtility committed wherein they were not on the</hi> Defenſive— <hi>This was</hi> all the Reaſon <hi>the Lord Deputy and Council had to call them</hi> Rebels, <hi>and to charge them in their Proclamation, dated</hi> March <hi>the</hi> 7th. 1688 <hi>with actual Rebellion, and with Killing and Murthering ſeveral of his Majeſties Subjects, and with Pillaging and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Country; whereas</hi> it was notorious <hi>they never</hi> kill'd <hi>any whom they did not find actually Robbing</hi>— <hi>And for</hi> Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, <hi>it is</hi> no leſs notorious <hi>that they Preſerved the whole Country within their Aſſociations from being Pillaged, when all the reſt of</hi> Ireland <hi>was Deſtroyed And their great Care of themſelves and their Country was the Crime which truly provoked the Lord Deputy, and made him except from pardon</hi> Twelve <hi>of the principal Eſtated Men in the</hi> North, <hi>when he ſent down Lieut. General</hi> Hamilton <hi>with an Army, which he tells us in the ſame Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation would inevitably occaſion the total Ruin and Deſtruction of the</hi> North.</p>
            <p>This is his Charge, and in his own Words. In Anſwer to which I will not take Advantage of his miſquoting this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, which we may ſuppoſe, for that Reaſon, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to Print among the very many Papers of far leſs Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which fill up his Appendix. But we have it Printed in one of the late <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtant Pamphlets, called, <hi>An Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the Proteſtants of</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I have annexed it to this, that you may ſee it; the Author calls the excepted Perſons, <hi>Twelve,</hi> whereas in the Proclamation there are but
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59238:53"/>
               <hi>Ten.</hi> I lay no great ſtreſs upon that difference of Number, it will not inhaunce the matter much: But it ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ws, that the Author has not been ſo exact in his Vouchers as he ought. Of which, or ſomething worſe, it is a much greater Proof, that in reciting the Cauſes which that Proclamation names for the Deſcent of that Army, he does not keep to the Words of the Proclamation, which inſtances Particulars this Author could not deny; as <hi>Breaking of Priſons, Diſcharging of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners</hi>— <hi>Seizing upon his Majeſties Arms and Ammunition, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning ſeveral of his Majeſties Army, Diſarming and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting them,</hi> &amp;c. But the Author wiſely avoids naming any of theſe, leaſt he ſhould be oblig'd to diſprove them; only ſays in general, as you have heard, That the Proclamation charges them with Rebellion, Killing, Plundering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which he manfully denies every Word of it. Therefore let us fairly Examine what I have before Quoted our of him. And that we may fix his looſe and artificial way of Dealing in Generals, ſliding unperceivably from one Matter to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and huddliug many Things together to diſtract the Reader, I will reduce his Charge to theſe Heads Firſt, That before the Deſcent of the Army, with whom came the Proclamation dated the 7th. of <hi>March.</hi> 1688. the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty did not ſo much as <hi>ſummon</hi> the Aſſociators in <hi>Ulſter.</hi> Secondly, I will Examine who thoſe great Robbers were in the <hi>North,</hi> who Plundered the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> there. And thirdly, We will ſee whether the <hi>Northern Aſſociators</hi> gave no other Provocation to the Government than to defend themſelves againſt theſe Robbers.</p>
            <p>For the Firſt, We are furniſhed with a Confutation of him, from the very Proclamation he Quotes, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the 7th. of <hi>March</hi> 1688. which mentions a former Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, requiring the <hi>Aſſociators</hi> to diſperſe, and promiſing them Pardon. There was one of this Nature, (I know not if there were any more) dated the 25th. of <hi>January</hi> 1688. which was ſign'd by ſeveral <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the Council, as the Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keting, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides this, Mr. <hi>Oſborn</hi> was ſent down to the <hi>North,</hi> by my Lord Deputy before the March of the Army, to uſe all Perſwaſions to them to lay down their Arms, to tell them the very Day the Army would March, and he kept it. That
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59238:53"/>though <hi>Ten</hi> were excepted in the Proclamation, yet he would inſiſt but upon <hi>Three;</hi> and if it ſhould appear that they took up Arms meerly for Self-preſervation, then he would Pardon even the ſaid <hi>three</hi> Perſons alſo. That he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded no more of them than to deliver up their Arms and ſerviceable Horſes, as you may ſee in Mr <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Letter to the Lord <hi>Mazereene</hi> of the 9th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1688. which I have taken out of the aboveſaid <hi>Apology for the Proteſtants in Ireland,</hi> and affixed to this n. 3.</p>
            <p>Add to this the offers which my Lord Deputy ſent to the Gentlemen in the North by Sir <hi>Robert Colvill, viz.</hi> That if his Country-men would continue Quiet in their reſpective Habitations, they ſhould be only Charg'd with the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of two Regiments. This is told in the <hi>Faithful Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> p. 10. and this was long before the March of that Army to the <hi>North.</hi> I have heard of ſeveral other <hi>Meſſages,</hi> and even <hi>Arts,</hi> that my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> uſed to Quiet the Diſturbances in the <hi>North,</hi> of which he was, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, very Apprehenſive, and uſed his utmoſt Endeavours to appeaſe them, as all the Accounts the <hi>Iriſh Protestants</hi> have Printed here do with one Conſent declare: And I have heard ſome of them ſay, That they dreaded nothing ſo much as that <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> durſt not ſend an Army againſt them, and that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> would ſubmit without any Oppoſition, and ſo they would get no <hi>Forfeitures,</hi> ſo much they overvalued, and their Enemies feared the ſtrength of the <hi>North,</hi> though both lived to ſee themſelves miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Let this ſuffice as to the firſt Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> did not forget to <hi>ſummon</hi> the <hi>North,</hi> before he ſent down the Army againſt them in <hi>March,</hi> 1688. If repeated <hi>Proclamations</hi> and <hi>Meſſages</hi> may be called <hi>Summons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the ſecond, of the great <hi>Robbers</hi> in the <hi>North.</hi> We do not ſpeak now of the common Robberies of High-way-men. That has always been, and will be in all Countries, more or leſs; but of ſuch Armed Bands of Robbers as forc'd the <hi>whole North</hi> to Arm and Regiment themſelves, and enter into <hi>Aſſociations</hi> and <hi>Confederacies,</hi> and a formal War to defend themſelves againſt theſe Robbers, who, he ſays, were Men <hi>intruſted by the Lord Deputy with Arms and Employments;</hi> ſo not common Robbers. And by the Account of all that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59238:54"/>came from the <hi>North,</hi> this was ſo far from being true, that the <hi>Iriſh there</hi> were in mortal Fear of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and commonly durſt not ſleep in their Houſes, but lay abroad in the Fields leaſt they ſhould fall upon them: No <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſuffered to live in the Country who did not take out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections from ſuch of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Gentry as were allowed by the <hi>Aſſociators</hi> to grant ſuch Protections: Nor durſt they Travel from their own Houſes without Paſſes, The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> made them contribute equally, <hi>at leaſt,</hi> with themſelves in all their new Levies, and forced them to work upon their new Fortifications, at their Pleaſure, which they did without grudging, and any thing to pleaſe thoſe who were abſolutely their Maſters, and in whoſe hands they reckoned their Lives to lye every moment; and many Inſults and Threatnings they bore from the Commonality of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> who made full uſe of their finding themſelves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from all Government, and to domineere over thoſe who were intirely at their mercy: The <hi>Faithful Hiſtory,</hi> p. 9. ſays, <hi>Amidſt thoſe Convulſions</hi> (Robberies in other Parts) <hi>the North only remained undiſturbed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author himſelf, in what I have already quoted, ſays plainly, That the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> kept <hi>the whole Country</hi> within their Aſſociations <hi>from being Pillaged.</hi> Where then were theſe great Robberies he ſpeaks of? He may ſay, <hi>In other Parts</hi> of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But that is not our preſent ſubject, but only the Condition of the <hi>North.</hi> And the Author places the Scene there, when he ſays, <hi>That they</hi> (the Gentlemen in the <hi>North</hi>) <hi>did not attempt any thing upon theſe Armed Robbers, except in their own defence, when Invaded and Aſſaulted by them, nor killed any but whom they found actually Robbing.</hi> So that all this muſt be in the <hi>North,</hi> where many Witneſſes atteſt, and the Author himſelf confeſſes, there was no ſuch thing. But p 100. he endeavours to prove it from Judge <hi>Keating</hi>'s Letter; the Paſſage is, p. 349. where the Judge ſays, <hi>In this Juncture of Affairs, the Thieves and Robbers are become numerous,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, When was this? The Letter is dated the 29th. of <hi>Dec.</hi> 1688. This, as has been ſhewn, was after the <hi>Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> and their being actually in Arms. And indeed when the Reins of Government were taken off the Necks of the People, there was nothing but Robbing and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59238:54"/>Depredations on all hands, which was the natural effect of it. But Judge <hi>Keating</hi> does not ſay it was the <hi>Iriſh</hi> robb'd the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for indeed they robb'd one another where they were able, and ſtood in equal fear, as he tells you, of one another; juſt as the Parts of the Country were planted, that is, as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> or the <hi>Britiſh</hi> were moſt numerous, or in beſt poſture for War. And he ſays plainly, p. 348. That <hi>the Proteſtants far exceeded them</hi> (the <hi>Iriſh</hi>) <hi>in the Northern Parts, and were extraordinarily well Arm'd and Hors'd.</hi> So that in the <hi>North</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtood in fear of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and therefore they were not the Robbers <hi>there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Author draws ſeveral Obſervables, p. 100. from this Letter. <hi>'Tis obſervable,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in this Letter, Firſt, That the Lord Deputy owns</hi>— So he makes this Letter the Act of the Lord Deputy; becauſe, as he ſays before, it was written by my Lord Deputies command, and peruſed by him. This he only aſſerts, and we have proof what ſtreſs is to be laid upon that; beſides, he raiſes a mean Character of his Friend Judge <hi>Keating,</hi> to think that he ſhould write Lyes for the Lord Deputy's command: If he did not, then <hi>it was not the Iriſh Army, but the Cottiers and Idlers who were the Robbers.</hi> For ſo his Letter ſays; <hi>And this,</hi> ſays our Author, <hi>ſufficiently ſhews the Falſhood of the Allegation whereby the Papiſts would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves, as if they had not begun to Rob, till the Proteſtant Aſſociations were ſet on foot, whereas thoſe were ſometime after this Letter, and occaſioned by the Robberies mentioned in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is contradicted by every <hi>Iriſh Proteſtant,</hi> and all their Narratives, as has been ſhewn; but nothing abates the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Talent of Aſſerting boldly. Whence in another <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable</hi> upon this Letter, he would have it believed that the Papiſts <hi>were in no fear from the Proteſtants:</hi> Which is not only againſt Matter of Fact, and fully atteſted, But it is againſt common Sence, or even Poſſibility. Whoever knows the Temper of both Sorts of theſe Men could never think it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, That where the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were many more in Number, and all up in Arms, chiefly pretended to be in odium to the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts,</hi> whom they called <hi>Bloody Dogs, Inhumane Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, Cut-throats,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Remember</hi> 41. which was the uſual Salutation they gave them, Who will think thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59238:55"/>were not afraid? Yet our Author will by no means allow it, for he has ſaid it.</p>
            <p>Now we are come to the third Point, <hi>viz. Whether the Northern Aſſociators gave no other Provocation to the Government, than to defend themſelves againſt thoſe Robbers?</hi> And this need no longer be inſiſted on, having ſhewn, That there were no ſuch Robbers.</p>
            <p>But I pray the Author to reſolve, If the beginning of their Aſſociating in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1688. and their actual Addreſs to the P. of <hi>O.</hi> in <hi>Nov.</hi> following, was only to ſave themſelves from Robbers? From being Robb'd by thoſe <hi>poor Iriſh</hi> whom they had panting under their Feet, in as much Subjection as ever a <hi>Hawk</hi> had a <hi>Lark?</hi> He ſays, <hi>The Aſſociators never attempted any thing even upon the Armed Robbers, except when they were Invaded and Aſſaulted by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was modeſt indeed! But were the Inhabitants of <hi>Eneskillen</hi> Invaded or Aſſaulted by the two Companies, againſt whom they march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out in Arms four Miles before they came near the Town? Or was <hi>Derry</hi> Aſſaulted by my Lord of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment before they Fir'd their Cannon from the Walls againſt them?</p>
            <p>But I have ſome further Queſtions to ask, from what I have learn'd out of the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> Narratives, and from ſome of themſelves; our Author ſays, <hi>It is notorious, that the Proteſtants</hi> (he means before the Deſcent of King <hi>James</hi>'s Army into the <hi>North</hi> in <hi>March</hi> 1688. for that is it we are ſpeaking of) <hi>never killed any whom they did not find actually Robbing.</hi> But I muſt tell our Author, that it is much more notoriouſly known, and granted by all the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants, nemine contradicente,</hi> That upon the 11th. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1688. there were ſome of Colonel <hi>Cormock O Neil</hi>'s Troop of Dragoons killed by the Proteſtant Forces at <hi>Tuam</hi> upon <hi>Loughneagh:</hi> the Quarrel you may ſee in the <hi>Faithful Hiſtory,</hi> p. 26. <hi>viz.</hi> They endeavoured that way to eſcape the <hi>Aſſociators,</hi> and get to their Quarters.

            </p>
            <p>Eut to return to the Story of Colonel <hi>Cormock O Neil;</hi> He having frequent Notices ſent him from Friends of his about <hi>Moyrah</hi> where liv'd Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden</hi> (generally then known by the Name of <hi>The Cock of the North,</hi> becauſe of his Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and great Forwardneſs in carrying on the <hi>Aſſociation</hi>) that Sir <hi>Arthur</hi> intended to ſeize him in his Houſe, and make him Priſoner, he, for his Security, retired to <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> where part of his Regiment of Foot was Quartered, leaving his Lady at his Houſe near <hi>Borogh-ſhane,</hi> with the Chaplain of his Regiment <hi>Maurice Dunkin</hi> Clark, Vicar of <hi>Glanarme</hi> in the County of <hi>Antrim,</hi> within eight Miles of <hi>Brogh-ſhane;</hi> thinking that a <hi>Proteſtant Clergy-man,</hi> and well known to all that Country, would be a Protection to his Lady, and the Houſe, ſhe being a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but the Colonel at that time a profeſſed <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> She hearing that the Confederate Aſſociators had fallen upon her Husband's Troop of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons at <hi>Tuam</hi> upon <hi>Logh Neagh,</hi> on Mund. 11. <hi>Febr.</hi> 88. grew apprehenſive of danger to her ſelf, and on Tueſday the 12th. ſhe went to Mr. <hi>White</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Borogh-ſhane,</hi> a Presbyterian Miniſter, who did protect her, not without ſome difficulty, from a Regiment of the <hi>Confederates</hi> under the Command of Mr. <hi>Adare</hi> (then made a Colonel by the P. of <hi>O.</hi> and ſince a Knight by K. <hi>W.</hi>) aſſiſted by Lieutenant <hi>Mitchelburn</hi> ſince made a Colonel. Theſe marched through <hi>Borogh-ſhane</hi> to the Siege of <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> (of which preſently) upon <hi>Aſhwed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,</hi> 13 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1688. <hi>a notorious Day which they did thus Solemnize!</hi>) and would needs Rifle this Lady, becauſe ſhe was a <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> and her Husband a Colonel in <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickfergus,</hi> which they were going to Beſiege. Mr. <hi>Dunkin,</hi> thinking he might have ſome Intereſt among them, at leaſt for his Character, endeavoured to perſwade them from ſuch a brutal Action; but they looked upon him as an Enemy, becauſe he was in the King's Service, and they not only Robb'd him, and beſides what was his own, took from him a Silver Bowl belonging to the Colonel, but ſtript him, and his Man, and one <hi>Arthur Dobbing,</hi> a Gentleman attending
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59238:56"/>upon the Lady; and would have broke into the Houſe to have Robb'd her, if not worſe, had not Mr. <hi>White</hi> violently interpos'd, and had that Credit with them, to preſerve the Lady, who was half dead with fear, and could hardly be led into her Coach: But Mr. <hi>White</hi> went with her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, till he brought her near <hi>Shanes-Caſtle,</hi> the Houſe of the Lady Marchioneſs of <hi>Antrim,</hi> to whom Mrs. <hi>O Neil</hi> fled for Protection, and where ſhe had a great fit of Sickneſs, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by theſe Frights. The Aſſociators having let her thus Eſcape, thought fit to Plunder her Houſe, which they did effectually, leaving nothing they could find belonging to the Colonel, or to her.</p>
            <p>Was <hi>this Lady,</hi> was Mr. <hi>Dunkin,</hi> were <hi>the Servants of the Colonel's Houſe,</hi> or his <hi>Stock, Goods,</hi> and <hi>Furniture,</hi> actually Aſſaulting and Robbing theſe <hi>Aſſociators?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had they read the <hi>Comminations</hi> of that Day in the Service of the Church, they might have found what Thanks they deſerv'd at God's hands; and what Bleſſings theſe Nations were to expect for what Things they were a doing <hi>that Day.</hi> The Anniverſary of which Day was Celebrated with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Glenco</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> 13 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1692.</p>
            <p>But to Return to our Hiſtory.

They do not pretend they ſound this Boat a Robbing, or that it Invaded or Aſſaulted them. In ſhort, they actually Beſieged <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> about the 20 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1688 it is true they did not take it. The Misfortunes of that Siege I leave to the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle. But it is not to be doubted they had prevail'd, if they had had either Cannon, Mortar, or Scaling Ladder; for the Men upon command Marcht up, and Fired their Muſquets againſt the Walls; and after they were Saluted by the Cannon from the Caſtle, they went back again. The truth is, They thought to have Surpriſed it, but it would not do.</p>

               <hi>February</hi> 1688. they conſulted how to come off with Honor, and enter'd into Articles, not to Surrender the Town, but to Raiſe the Siege: And theſe Articles were made to conſiſt with the Reputation of the <hi>Confederate</hi> Generals of the <hi>Aſſociation.</hi> One was, That Colonel <hi>Cormock O Neil</hi> ſhould Disband his Regiment (<hi>which was not in his Power to do.</hi>) Another, That the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi> ſhould be <hi>Permitted</hi> to take ſuch and ſuch Proviſions into <hi>Carrickfergus;</hi> and <hi>Permitted</hi> to ſend ſuch Letters to <hi>Dublin,</hi> as he ſhould ſhew to the Earl of <hi>Mount-Alexander,</hi> and other of the <hi>Confederate</hi> Nobility and Gentry. This was Great! It was taking ſomething more upon them than meerly to Defend themſelves from Robbers, when actually Aſſaulted by them, which our Author ſays, was all they did.</p>
            <p>But it not being likely that theſe Articles ſhould be kept, therefore (as a Salvo for the future Breach of them) it was put in the eighth Article, <hi>That theſe Articles ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in force whilſt no more Popiſh Forces were Sent into, or Raiſed in the Province of</hi> Ulſter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Confederate Aſſociators</hi> would not be ſtinted from Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what Forces they pleas'd: But they would Limit the <hi>King,</hi> that he ſhould Raiſe no more. This was not very likely to hold. And therefore theſe Articles were not long liv'd. But they ſerv'd to grace the Retreat of the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Army</hi> from before <hi>Carrickfergus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame unfortunate Stars prevented their ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon the Gariſons of <hi>Newry</hi> and <hi>Charlimont.</hi> So that though they often attempted, nothing ſucceeded with them, except my Lord <hi>Blaynie</hi>'s ſurpriſing a Troop of Dragoons at <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> whom they diſarm'd, took their Horſes from them, and made the Officers Priſoners. Did they find theſe Men actually Robbing whom they ſurpriſed in their Beds, or cureleſs in their Guard-houſe?</p>
            <p>They were not ſo lucky in their Deſign upon Sir <hi>Thomas Newcomen</hi>'s Regiment at <hi>Lisburn,</hi> though ſeveral of the Officers of the Regiment were upon the Plot, as Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> Captain <hi>Brimingham,</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Barnes,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Tubman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And though, as the <hi>Faithful Hiſtory</hi> tells you, pag. 12. Gaptain <hi>Leighton</hi> engaged to diſarm the whole Gariſon, with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59238:57"/>the Aſſiſtance only of as many Men as might ſerve to bring off their Arms, and that Sir <hi>Arthur R.</hi> was advanced with 500 Men within five Miles of the Town to make good the Attempt, yet it miſcarry'd; the Plot was diſcovered, and Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> marched away his Regiment; only thoſe Officers who had ingaged to betray the Guard, and deliver the Arms, thought fit to ſtay behind, and run the Fate of the <hi>Aſſociation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take notice here that this was one of the <hi>two Regiments</hi> which by my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Ingagement were to be the <hi>Quota</hi> of the <hi>North,</hi> to free them from all fear, or a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their being either Aſſaſſinated or Plundered by the Army among them; who, by this means, were ſo few, as to be perfectly in the Power of the Country, and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> who commanded one of them, was a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> The other Regiment was my Lord <hi>Antrim</hi>'s, and both theſe (as the <hi>Faithful Hiſtory</hi> tells, p. 11.) hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed at this time to be Gariſon'd in <hi>Lisburn, Belfaſt, Carickfergus,</hi> and other adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Places. <hi>When upon a ſolemn Debate by a Committee of ſuch as had Subſcribed the Aſſociation it was concluded, that</hi> both <hi>theſe</hi> Regiments <hi>ſhould be diſarm'd, and the Caſtle of</hi> Carrickfergus <hi>ſecured, in which were Arms for two Regiments more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon the ſtrength of this Attempt they purpoſed to have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> Tyrconnel <hi>upon equal Terms; and by putting a Gariſon into the</hi> Newry, <hi>they hoped to have ſtop'd that Paſs, and thereby to have ſecur'd the two Counties of</hi> Downe <hi>and</hi> Antrim <hi>for the Proteſtant Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Words of the Hiſtory. And let our Author judge if this was only Acting <hi>upon the Defenſive,</hi> never At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any thing but in their own Defence, <hi>when Invaded and Aſſaulted by Robbers.</hi> Which he aſſerts as a <hi>notorious Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At a Place called <hi>Killough</hi> in the County of <hi>Downe,</hi> The <hi>Aſſociators</hi> ſeized ſome Barrels of Gun-powder, which the Lord Deputy was ſending to <hi>Londonderry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long before this, Sir <hi>Gerard Irwin</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> whoſe Eſtate lies near <hi>Eneskillen,</hi> carrying Arms, by order of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſome of the King's Forces in the <hi>North,</hi> was ſet upon, in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> by Gentlemen of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> all the Arms were taken from him, and made uſe of to Arm their own Men. They did not find him <hi>actually Robbing,</hi> nor
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59238:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>did he <hi>Invade</hi> or <hi>Aſſault</hi> them. All theſe things our Author has to Anſwer.</p>
            <p>And many more Inſtances might be given: They tell me that hardly a Day paſt in the <hi>North,</hi> without ſomething of this Nature. The Priſon at <hi>Cavan</hi> was broken open by the <hi>Aſſociators,</hi> and the Priſoners ſet at Liberty. The like was done in other Northern Counties; for ought I know in all. Of this the Lord Deputy complains in that ſame Parliament which our Author quotes of the 7th of <hi>March</hi> 88. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſhould have conſidered, whether theſe Priſoners or their Creditors were actually Robbing and Aſſaulting theſe <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciators,</hi> or whether this was no Offence againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at their own hand, and without Law, to releaſe Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Fellons, Thieves, and Murderers? and how he will bring this about to be meerly Acting on the <hi>Defenſive.</hi> As likewiſe their ordering the Collectors of the Revenue (moſt of whom, if not all, in the <hi>North,</hi> joyn'd with them) to bring in to them the King's Money (after the Example of their Friends in <hi>England</hi>) <hi>being for their Majeſty's Service.</hi> But their Reign was ſo ſhort, that I think their Accompts amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to no great matter.</p>
            <p>But to make an end of this Head, <hi>viz. Whether the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Aſſociators gave no other Provocation to the Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Deſcent of the Army in</hi> March 88. <hi>than to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Robbers?</hi> Before this Army came down, they had received Commiſſions from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> even before he was declared King in <hi>England;</hi> for his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bore date before that time, <hi>viz. Feb.</hi> 5.88. as you will ſee by one of the ſubaltern Commiſſions which was ſhewn to me, the Copy of which I have annexed <hi>numb.</hi> 18. Theſe Commiſſions were brought over by Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> whom the <hi>Aſſociators</hi> ſent to the Prince, to manage their Buſineſs, and procure theſs Commiſſions, which I am told his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was very unwilling to grant, thinking it raſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable; but was over-powered by their Importunity. In ſhort, they not only acted by theſe Commiſſions, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the <hi>Prince</hi> for their <hi>King,</hi> before the Deſcent of that Army. This you will allow to be ſomewhat of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than bare <hi>Self-defence</hi> againſt <hi>Robbers.</hi> And now judge, whether, as our Author ſays, this, (viz. <hi>Defending themſelves

               </hi>) was all the reaſon the Lord Deputy and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had to call them <hi>Rebels,</hi> &amp;c. and to ſend that Army to Reduce them. Yet this Author, from p. 111. to 117. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs bitterly againſt the Government's <hi>diſarming</hi> the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in <hi>Dublin</hi> 24 <hi>Feb.</hi> 88. and again by King <hi>James</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation dated 20 <hi>July</hi> 89. and makes this no leſs a <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> than the <hi>French Dragooning,</hi> and a plain Deſign to rob them of all their Eſtates and Property, and put them to a <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe he muſt foreſee how horribly ridiculous, even to madneſs, it wou'd appear to make all theſe Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for <hi>diſarming ones Enemies,</hi> which none but Fools would neglect, he brings himſelf off thus. C. 3. ſ. 8. n. 20. p. 116. <hi>It may perhaps be imagined</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by thoſe who are Strangers to our Affairs, that we had abus'd our Arms to oppreſs or wrong our Neighbours, or to oppoſe the King, and therefore deſerv'd to loſe them. But it is obſervable, that it doth not appear that any one</hi> Proteſtant <hi>in</hi> Ireland, before this diſarming, <hi>had us'd his Arms to injure any</hi> Roman Catholick, <hi>nor did they hurt any that was not either actually Robbing them of their Goods, or Aſſaulting their Perſons; no not in the</hi> North, <hi>where they refus'd to give up their Arms; they kept even there on the Defenſive, and offended no Man but when firſt aſſaulted: ſo that there was not the leaſt Reaſon or Colour to diſarm us.</hi> Thus our Author; and a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>You have heard what the Proteſtants did before the firſt Diſarming, 24 <hi>Feb.</hi> 89. But the ſecond, which was 20 <hi>July</hi> 89. was in the very heat of the War 'twixt King <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>Northern Aſſociators: Kirk</hi> was come from <hi>England,</hi> and Riding with his Ships in <hi>Lough Foyle,</hi> for the relief of <hi>Derry.</hi> This <hi>Diſarming</hi> was but ten days before Lieutenant-General <hi>Mack Carty</hi> was defeated, and himſelf taken Priſoner at <hi>Eneskillen,</hi> and but eleven days before the Relief of <hi>Derry,</hi> which was the firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the other the laſt of <hi>July</hi> 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and a Month after, <hi>Schomberg</hi> landed with the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army. Yet all this notwithſtanding, our Author is very ſure, that <hi>not one Proteſtant in</hi> Ireland, <hi>before this Diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no not in the</hi> North, had oppos'd King <hi>James; ſo that there was not the leaſt Reaſon or Colour to Diſarm them.</hi> This Author knows very well, that long before this the People of <hi>Derry</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59238:58"/>took out their Pardon for ſhutting their Gates againſt the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment; which was a confeſſion of ſome ſort of Guilt. Though none could imagine he had ever been inform'd of theſe things. It is true he was in <hi>Dublin</hi> at that time, and ſo might not know, if you can think that poſſible. But he has been ſince in the <hi>North,</hi> where his Friends and Relations live, and is now in a great Poſt there, even in <hi>Derry,</hi> and was a conſiderable while before he wrote this Book: and if his Intelligence can be ſo bad, where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, it is capable of knowing moſt, we may juſtly ſuſpect him in other matters, and where he aſſumes to paſs Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the <hi>Arcana</hi> of all the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> as if he had been of the Cabinet Council to all the Governments in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. He tells you, p. 9 where King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second miſtook his Meaſures; and if he had taken the Author's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, wou'd, in all probability, have humbled that <hi>French Monarch</hi> to the advantage of all <hi>Europe.</hi> And p. 14 and 15. he reads the ſame <hi>Politicks</hi> to <hi>France, Savoy,</hi> the <hi>Emperor,</hi> &amp;c. and tells them their true Intereſt, and what may ruin their Countries. But this is ſo familiar with him, and you will meet with it ſo often, that I will not trouble you with Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; you may trace him by the <hi>Obſervator.</hi> Thus much for what he aſſerts n. 9. p. 105. <hi>viz.</hi> That there was no Provocation given by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> for the Lord Deputy to ſend down an Army againſt them in <hi>March</hi> 1688.</p>
            <p>All this concerns the <hi>North,</hi> where this Author then was not; but to ſhew that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> even in <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Author was, were not idle, he tells, p. 97. and 98. of a Plot they had; no leſs than to ſeize the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> himſelf, with the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> where the Stores of Arms and Ammunition lay. And this he takes pains to demonſtrate to have been very feaſible, and diſcovers plainly a regret, and diſdain at their Loyalty who hinder'd it: He in a witty Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſm lays the blame upon <hi>that mighty Veneration to the very Name of Authority, in which the Proteſtants had been educated;</hi> and particularly he ſays, Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> laboured to prevent this Plot <hi>as if he himſelf had been to periſh in it.</hi> That was for his Pains, he needed not to have been ſo fierce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59238:59"/>But though their not agreeing among themſelves, and their being yet tender and unacquainted with Rebellion, and therefore ſtarted at the firſt Sin, like fearful Sinners; tho they had not got rid of the <hi>Slaviſh Non-Reſiſtance Doctrine,</hi> (I believe our Author himſelf was not quite got off it then) yet they had made ſuch Progreſs at that very Beginning, that none diſcovered this Plot; and it may be we ſhould not have known it at this diſtance, if our Author had not oblig'd us with the Diſcovery; for I never heard of it before; and he tells us that this was long before K. <hi>James</hi> deſerted <hi>England.</hi> It was when he ſent Commiſſioners to treat <hi>with the Prince of Orange:</hi> But I think, under favour, that our Author did not do well to make this publick, becauſe it does juſtifie the Suſpicion which the Government had of the Proteſtants there from the beginning.</p>
            <p>But this Author has ſometimes a ſtrange faculty of Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; for in the very next Words, after telling of this Plot of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and how prevented, p. 98. he ſays. <hi>The truth is, it was an unanimous Reſolution of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the Kingdom, that they would not be the Aggreſſors; and they held ſtedfaſtly to their Reſolution,</hi> as you have heard.</p>
            <p>The matter is, in every Paragraph he is too intent to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Point he is upon to the utmoſt, leſt it ſhould loſe by his telling; therefore ſometimes he may ſlip as to the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Truth: This is the reaſon he ſo often ſeems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf, and builds that up in one place which he throws down in another. Who would not think he had been in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. p. 226. where telling how <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate put off the Primitive Chriſtians Petitions for Juſtice, by telling them, their <hi>Maſter adviſed them to be patient, and pronounced them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when perſecuted. And we,</hi> ſays this Author, <hi>did exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Advice, though given in raillery, and did not make the</hi> leaſt ſtep <hi>to right our ſelves by Force, till God's Providence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſignally for theſe Kingdoms, in raiſing them up a Deliverer; and putting the Crown on their Majesties Heads.</hi> Thus our Author. This was to let People think, <hi>if they pleaſed,</hi> that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> did not make <hi>the leaſt ſtep</hi> to right themſelves by Force againſt King <hi>James</hi> till the <hi>Coronation</hi> of K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> But if that will not paſs, then our Author ſaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſaying, he did not mean that, but till God raiſed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59238:59"/>them up a Deliverer. And when was that? I ſuppoſe as ſoon as they knew of the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Deſign to come and help them: and that was as ſoon as King <hi>James</hi> himſelf does charge them with it. This Author means, they would not take Arms, till they thought to do ſome good with them: But why did he joyn theſe two Terms of the <hi>Prince's first De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> and his <hi>Coronation,</hi> ſo cloſe together, with the Copulative <hi>And,</hi> as if he had been ſpeaking of the ſelf ſame Action? It was to give you leave to take it for the ſame, it you did not mind it. But all this while, where is this ſuffering Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which this Author ſays, they did ſo exactly follow? He means, they ſuffered while they could not help it.</p>
            <p>But let us go on to ſome more of his Matters of Fact.</p>

            <p>But in the next place, as to letting looſe his Army to Spoil and Plunder.</p>

In this Letter, the Dr. tells, <hi>how it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to treat the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Proteſtants of</hi> Ulſter <hi>rather as Enemies than Friends,—that the Goods and Stocks of the Proteſtant Inhabitants once ſeized by the Enemy were Forfeited and ought not to be Reſtor'd, but given as encouragement to the Soldiers—that their (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) Oaths and Complaints were neither to be Believed nor Redreſs'd, that ſo an eaſier and ſafer approach might be made to invade the little left them by the</hi> Iriſh— <hi>That free Quartering was the leaſt Retaliation that Proteſtants could give, for being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their former Eſtates— If you add to theſe, the Preſſing of Horſes at pleaſure, Quartering at pleaſure, Robbing and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering at pleaſure, Denying the People Bread, or Seed of their own Corn, though the General by his publick Proclamation requires both, and ſome Openly and Publickly contemning and ſcorning the ſaid Proclamation, whereby Multitudes of Families are already reduced for want of Bread, and left only to Beg, and Steal, or Starve. Theſe being the Practices, and theſe the Principles, and both as well known to you as to me, it cannot be wondered that the</hi> oppreſs'd Proteſtants <hi>here ſhould report us worſe than the</hi> Iriſh.</p>
            <p>May be you may think that theſe poor Proteſtants had provok'd the Army ſome way.

How frequently do we hear them tell us, That though we continue to Injure them, Rob and Deſtroy them, yet they muſt Truſt in us, and be True and Faithful to us?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Words of the Doctor's Letter, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will be thought but an over good Retortion of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Spoil and Plunder committed by King <hi>James</hi>'s Army.

               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59238:60"/>And now as to the other Point, <hi>viz.</hi> My Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s haſte in ſending that Army into the <hi>North,</hi> I ſuppoſe our Author intends this for <hi>Politicks:</hi> and upon that head (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out medling with the Goodneſs or Badneſs of the Cauſe) I think my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> was rather <hi>too ſlow,</hi> to ſuffer the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> to be <hi>Arming, Inliſting, Aſſociating,</hi> againſt the Government, actually <hi>Aſſaulting</hi> the Kings Forts and Garriſons, <hi>Diſarming</hi> his Souldiers, and <hi>killing</hi> ſome of them; at laſt, publickly renouncing the King, and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Foreign Prince for their King, and acting in his Name, and by his Commiſſion; and all this was a doing, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly carrying on from <hi>September</hi> to <hi>March,</hi> which truly in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks</hi> was rather <hi>too long</hi> to ſuffer it to run. And if that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had not gone down when it did againſt the <hi>Aſſociators</hi> in the <hi>North;</hi> it wou'd never have been able to reduce them as it did: which appears by the Defence a few of them made afterwards at <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Eniskillen.</hi> And therefore I do not ſee any ground to blame my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> for ſending that Army <hi>ſo ſoon,</hi> conſidering that he thought it a good Cauſe in which he was engag'd. But eſpecially conſidering that our Author himſelf calls him a <hi>Fool</hi> for not dealing more briskly with the <hi>North</hi> in time. He laughs at the Lord Deputy for leaving <hi>Derry</hi> ſo ill guarded, as that they were able to ſeize it; <hi>It proceeded</hi> (ſays this Author, c. 3 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was the 7th or 8th of <hi>December</hi> 88. that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſeized <hi>Derry</hi> the firſt time, and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army did not come to <hi>Drommore</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> till the 14th of <hi>March</hi> following, tho all that time the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their Opportunity, and every day committing Inſults upon that ſmall part of the Army (only two Regiments) which was Quartered among them: But, as our Author ſays
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59238:61"/>in the ſame Page, <hi>the Lord Deputy bethought himſelf too late of his Error, but could never retrieve it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyſe</hi>'s Narrative, p. 13. ſays, That my Lord <hi>Tyrcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> deferr'd the ſending down his Army <hi>twenty days</hi> after it had been firſt reſolved on in Council.</p>
            <p>I have another Account which confirms all this; <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Granard</hi> upon his leaving <hi>Dublin,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>Feb.</hi> 88. to go to <hi>Caſtle Forbes,</hi> deſired a Perſon who went with him as far as <hi>Chappeliſard,</hi> to pretend ſome Buſineſs with my <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> on purpoſe to find out whether he deſigned to ſend the Army againſt the <hi>North;</hi> and that Perſon went to the <hi>Lord Deputy</hi> that ſame day, and asked him why he would ſuffer a Rabble in the <hi>North</hi> to affront the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſeeing a few of the Army would diſperſe them, the Lord <hi>Deputy</hi> adſwered, That he was unwilling to ingage in Blood, hoping they would of themſelves reflect and come to a better temper. But that now ſince General<note n="*" place="margin">This was a Son of the Lord <hi>Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reen</hi>'s, whoſe Souldiers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the King's Forces at <hi>Tuam.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Scevington</hi> had made the firſt Rupture by falling upon and killing ſome of the Souldiers at <hi>Tuam</hi> he would ſend with what Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he could to Quaſh the Rebellion, and let them blame themſelves for the Conſequence. This I have from that Perſon himſelf; and yet the Army did not go to the <hi>North</hi> till the 11th. or 12th. of the <hi>March</hi> following.</p>
            <p>But this Author ſays (as above c. 3. § 8. n. 10.) that if he had delayed a little longer till King <hi>James</hi> had come, then in all Probability, <hi>if King</hi> James <hi>himſelf appeared amongſt them, and offered them Terms, they would have complied with him at leaſt ſo far as to ſubmit Quietly to his Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Author thinks this, I confeſs, he is the firſt <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> that ever I found of that Opinion.</p>
            <p>And the iſſue did pretty well prove it: For after, when the <hi>Aſſociators</hi> were beaten, at <hi>Drumore,</hi> at <hi>Colerain,</hi> at <hi>Clady,</hi> and driven into <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Enneskillen,</hi> and when King <hi>James</hi> appeared amongſt them, and offered them what Terms they pleaſed, they value themſelves upon refuſing all Terms, and holding out: But may be this Author thinks, That if they had beaten King <hi>James</hi>'s Army, they would have been better diſpoſed to have received Terms from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59238:61"/>But, pray,<note place="margin">The Author's Character of K. <hi>J.</hi>
               </note> how does all this agree with the Character which this Author raiſes of K. <hi>J.</hi> in this Book? Wherein he repreſents him as a faithleſs, mercileſs, and bigotted Tyrant, who deſigned to deſtroy all the Proteſtants, and went as far in it as he could, and employed Perſons moſt inclined and fitted to do it; and that no Truſt was to be given to his Word, or to his Oath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But I muſt tell the Author, That as to K. <hi>J.</hi> in his own Perſon, there is another Man has given his Character, who had more reaſon to know him than this Author, and is at leaſt as good a Judge; that is the Lord <hi>Danby,</hi> (ſtil'd at preſent <hi>Lord Marqueſs of</hi> Carmarthen) who in the Speech he made to the Gentlemen aſſembled in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi>

And yet this Author, <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>ſ.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 23. would have us believe <hi>That the Duke uſed his Interest with the King to put a ſtop to them, but was not able to do it.</hi> I farther appeal to that noble Lord the E. of <hi>Granard,</hi> whether the ſame day that the News of the driving the Proteſtants before the Walls of <hi>Derry</hi> come to <hi>Dublin,</hi> as his Lordſhip was going to the Parliament Houſe, he did not meet K. <hi>J.</hi> who asked him where he was going? His Lordſhip anſwered, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Proteſtation againſt the Repeal of the Acts of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement: Upon which K. <hi>J.</hi> told him, <hi>That he was fallen into the hands of a People who ramm'd that and many other things down his Throat.</hi> His Lordſhip took that occaſion to tell his Majeſty of the driving before <hi>Derry.</hi> The King told him that he was grieved for it; That he had ſent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Orders to diſcharge it; and that none but a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Moſcovite</hi> (ſo he ſtiled General <hi>Roſen,</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that driving, who thereby it ſeems was bred or born in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi>) could have thought of ſo cruel a Contrivance.</p>
            <p>Let me add to this Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Granard</hi>'s what I had from the Mouth of a <hi>Scots Clergyman,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in King <hi>James</hi>'s Army the 26th of <hi>June,</hi> 1690. (the Thurſday before the <hi>Boyne</hi>) asked Major-General <hi>Maxwell,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> how K. <hi>J.</hi> came to paſs the Act of Attainder, and the Repeal of the Acts of Settlement, being at that time ſo viſibly againſt his Intereſt? The General replied, <hi>Sir, if you did but know the Circumſtances the King is under, and the Hardſhips theſe Men</hi> (the Iriſh) <hi>put upon him, you would bemoan him with Tears, inſtead of blaming him. But what would you have him to do? All his other Subjects have deſerted him; this is the only Body of Men he has to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for him; he is in their hands, and he muſt pleaſe them.</hi> Yet this Author affirms confidently, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 20. <hi>p.</hi> 163. <hi>That</hi> K. J. <hi>of his own accord was the firſt who motioned the Repealing of the Acts of Settlement, in his Speech at the opening of the Parliament in</hi> Dublin. But the Author has not annexed that Speech in his long <hi>Appendix,</hi> where many other Papers of greater Bulk, leſs Conſequence, and much
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59238:62"/>harder to be procured, are inſerted at large: But no doubt he had a Reaſon for it; therefore I have annexed it to this, <hi>No.</hi> 1. and there you will ſee not a Word of what this Author avers, but rather the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the King did not deſire a Repeal of the Acts of Settlement, but only a Relief to ſuch as had been injured by thoſe Acts, which may happen in the juſteſt Acts in the World, eſpecially of the Settlement of a whole Nation, after ſuch a Rebellion and terrible Revolution as that of 41. And K. <hi>J.</hi> there deſires no farther for them, than may be conſiſtent <hi>with Reaſon, Juſtice, and the publick Good of his People.</hi> All the Words of his Speech, which relate to the <hi>Acts of Settlement,</hi> are theſe, <hi>I ſhall alſo moſt readily conſent to the making ſuch good and wholſom Laws as may be for the general Good of the Nation, the Improvement of Trade, and the Relieving ſuch as have been injured by the late Acts of Settlement, as far forth as may be conſiſtent with Reaſon, Juſtice, and the Publick Good of my People.</hi> Theſe are his Words; and if our Author had ſet them down, he would have thought it a hard Task to have found fault with them. I never heard any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſay but that there were many hard Caſes, and even unjuſt, in the <hi>Acts of Settlement:</hi> But they excuſe it, by ſaying that it is impoſſible to be otherwiſe in ſo general and great a Settlement, where ſo many thouſands are concerned; and that it is better to bear with that, than to unſettle a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may have worſe Conſequences, and fall into the like Miſtakes again and again. And this ſeems to be King <hi>James</hi>'s Senſe of that Matter all along. But will any ſay that ſuch as ſhall appear to be injured ought not to be redreſſed, if a way can be found agreeable to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Publick Good?</hi> This would be to plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and likewiſe againſt the <hi>Publick Good.</hi> I am told that King <hi>James</hi>'s meaning was, to have a Sum of Money raiſed for ſuch as had been injur'd by the Acts of Settlement; but by no means to encroach upon the Acts: And what Fault could our Author have found with this? unleſs he thinks that Juſtice ought not to be done to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or not to be executed <hi>againſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants;</hi> which may be the Reaſon why in all his Railings at the cruel Act of Attainder, he has forgot to give one
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59238:63"/>Reaſon why <hi>Rebels</hi> ſhould not be <hi>attainted,</hi> or why theſe <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> ſhould not have been ſo dealt with, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be <hi>Rebels,</hi> as K. <hi>J.</hi> and that Parliament did certainly ſuppoſe. But was it not very cruel to attaint <hi>ſo many?</hi> To this they will reply, was it not as <hi>cruel,</hi> and <hi>more criminal,</hi> that <hi>ſo many</hi> ſhould be <hi>Rebels?</hi> But this is ſaid only for Arguments ſake; for it is moſt certain that K. <hi>J.</hi> did not propoſe, nor was inclined, either to this Act of Attainder, or to the Repeal of the Acts of Settlement, as this Author ſlanderouſly reports of him; but with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill luck as to his Vouchers, of which he gives another Inſtance, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 145. where he ſays it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Chief Juſtice <hi>Nugent</hi> and Baron <hi>Rice</hi> ſucceeded in their Deſign, when they came over to England, <hi>in Spring,</hi> 88. <hi>to concert the methods of Repealing the Acts of Settlement.</hi> Whereas all here upon the place know that K. <hi>J.</hi> did then poſitively refuſe to conſent to it; which my Lord <hi>Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> does witneſs in his Letter of the 23 of <hi>March,</hi> 89. and ſays that <hi>the King was reſolved not to think of that year, and perhaps never.</hi> And yet this Author confidently quotes that very Letter in this ſame place, as a Voucher on his ſide; but he has not put it in his <hi>Appendix:</hi> Therefore I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed it to this, <hi>No.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>I will give you a farther Proof of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Zeal to preſerve the Acts of <hi>Settlement.</hi> It is well known that the Addreſs of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> in behalf of the Purchaſers under the Acts of Settlement and Explanation, and the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi>'s Speech, ſet down at large in this Author's <hi>Appendix,</hi> were ſubſequent to ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences K. <hi>J.</hi> had with ſeveral of the Members of the Houſe of Commons; and with a Committee of that Houſe, in Preſence of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Nugent,</hi> Lord Chief Baron <hi>Rice,</hi> Judge <hi>Daily,</hi> and Attorney-General <hi>Neagle,</hi> and others of the Privy Council; where K <hi>J.</hi> plainly laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the Unreaſonableneſs of their Proceedings; That it was not proper to enter upon ſo great a matter as the deſtroying the ſaid Acts, in time of War, when all Parties could not be heard; and ſome of the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Judges declared, not only to the King, but to the ſaid Committee, and to ſeveral of both Houſes of Parliament
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59238:63"/>and of the Privy Council, That it was unjuſt to break the Acts, and deſtroy Purchaſers, Widows, Orphans, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and all Traders, on pretence to relieve Widows and Orphans. And one of the Roman Catholick Judges did reduce this into Writing, and ſhewed it to the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> who had a Copy of it, as appears under his hand; and that the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> had the Peruſal of it, and, as I am credibly informed, had a Copy of it. All which was before the ſaid <hi>Addreſs</hi> and <hi>Speech;</hi> and though ſhotter, is as full for the Preſervation of the Settlement, as the ſaid <hi>Addreſs</hi> and <hi>Speech.</hi> And it appears plainly by what Duke <hi>Powis</hi> ſaid from the King to the Earl of <hi>Granard,</hi> &amp;c. that K. <hi>J.</hi> did encourage the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Lords of Parliament to oppoſe the Repeal of the Acts of Sertlement; and therefore their appearing in this matter ought by no means to be made an Objection againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> but in truth is an Argument of the pains he took to oppoſe the Repeal; and it would be a Scandal to doubt but that theſe Proteſtant Lords meant it at that time ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely for King <hi>James</hi>'s Service; which is farther demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable from the Loyal zeal which carried the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> ſo far, as to deſire leave from K. <hi>J.</hi> to attend upon his Majeſty to the <hi>Boyne,</hi> to aſſiſt him againſt his Enemies. But <hi>Achiſh</hi> excuſed <hi>David</hi> with Commendations of his Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 29.) His Lordſhip was likewiſe one of the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> mentioned in the Addreſs of the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> to K. <hi>J.</hi> on the 10th of <hi>May,</hi> 89. which was Printed with K. <hi>James</hi>'s Speech, and is here annexed, <hi>No.</hi> 1. <q>In this Addreſs they abhor the unnatural Uſurpation  of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the Treaſon of thoſe who joyned with him in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and profeſs to K. <hi>J.</hi> with Tongue and Heart, That they will ever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his Rights to his Crown with their Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, againſt the ſaid <hi>Uſurper</hi> and his Adherents, and all other Rebels and Traytors whatſoever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Words of the Addreſs, as you may ſee in the Appendix. Now whether the <hi>Troteſtant</hi> Biſhops (<hi>for no other ſat in that Parliament</hi>) did enter their Proteſtation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Addreſs which was made in their Names, or whether they did not give their Votes to it, themſelves

            <p>It is a Melancholy Story (if true) which Sir <hi>Theobald Butler,</hi> Solicitor General to K. <hi>J.</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> tells of the D. of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s ſending him to K. <hi>J.</hi> with a Letter about paſſing ſome Lands for the ſaid Duke; he imploying Sir <hi>Theob.</hi> in his Buſineſs, gave him the Letter open to read, which Sir <hi>Theob.</hi> ſays he found worded in terms ſo Inſolent and Impoſing, as would be unbecoming for one Gentleman to offer to another. Sir <hi>Theob.</hi> ſays he could not but repreſent to the Duke the ſtrange ſurpriſe he was in at his treating the King at ſuch a rate, and deſired to be excuſed from being the Meſſenger to give ſuch a Letter into the King's Hands. The Duke ſmiled upon him, and told him he knew how to deal with the King at that time, that he muſt have his Buſineſs done; and for <hi>Theobald</hi>'s ſcruple, he ſealed the Letter, and told him, now the King cannot ſuppoſe you know the Contents, only carry it to him as from me. Sir <hi>Theob.</hi> did ſo, and, ſays he obſerved the King narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he read it, and that His Majeſty did ſhew great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, that he changed Colours, and Sighed often, yet ordered <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Requeſt; or <hi>Demand</hi> rather, to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59238:64"/>would not detain the Reader; what I have ſaid is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſufficient to ſhew how far it was from his own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, either to <hi>ſuffer</hi> or <hi>do</hi> ſuch things as were thus vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently put upon him by the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in his Extremity.</p>
            <p>Yet nothing of all this, it ſeems, has weighed any thing with theſe <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants,</hi> at leaſt with <hi>this Author,</hi> to have any milder Thoughts of K. <hi>J.</hi> or to confeſs to the World, what they very well know, <hi>viz.</hi> That King <hi>James</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Paſſing of the Act of Attainder, and Repeal of the Acts of Settlement, all that he could, and made uſe of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (who now accuſe him) to help him in it: And this Truth is ſo apparent, that it forces it ſelf ſometimes out of their Mouths who endeavour to conceal it. This Author, <hi>c</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 9. <hi>n.</hi> 12 <hi>p.</hi> 150. ſays, That <hi>K.</hi> J. <hi>made uſe of them</hi> (the Proteſtant Biſhops) <hi>to moderate by way of Counterpoiſe the madneſs of his own Party;</hi> and yet, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, all the madneſs of that Party muſt be charged upon the King: And K. <hi>J.</hi> (as this Author in the Heads of his Diſcourſe, <hi>c</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 20. <hi>diviſion</hi> 2. undertakes to prove) <hi>would not hear the</hi> Proteſtants <hi>at the Bar against the Repeal.</hi> In his Book where he comes to prove this, he only ſays that the Proteſtants <hi>were denied to be heard at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, and an Order made that nothing ſhould be offered in their Favour.</hi> Firſt, This is only his ſaying, he produces no ſuch Order, nor any Vouchers. Secondly, If the Lords made ſuch an Order, What is that to the King? They did many Things againſt His Will, as I have ſhewn the <hi>Repeal</hi> it ſelf to be; and this Author knows it, yet he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges all upon K. <hi>J.</hi> himſelf. Well! God forgive this Author, he has written every Word with the Spirit of Malice againſt his much injur'd Sovereign, to whom he had <hi>ſworn,</hi> who fell by other Mens Faults rather than His own; and being down, all preſs upon Him, and try who can wound Him deepeſt; even thoſe who Flattered Him, Addreſſed to Him, and were obliged by Him when in Power.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">This Author was guilty of Treaſon againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Favor.</note>Nay, I have been told, That the Author owes it to King <hi>James</hi>'s Mercy, that he now lives to thank him for his Goodneſs. Was not be accuſed for holding Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and giving Intelligence to the <hi>Rebels</hi> (as they were then called) both in <hi>England</hi> and the North of <hi>Ireland?</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59238:65"/>And was it not true? Did he not give frequent Intelligence to <hi>Schomberg</hi> by one <hi>Sherman,</hi> and keep conſtant Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with Mr. <hi>Tollet</hi> and others in <hi>London?</hi> He knows this would have been called <hi>Treaſon</hi> in thoſe days, and a bloody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded <hi>Tyrant</hi> would have found another Remedy for it than a ſhort Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>And you may ſee, by the vaſt number of Papers which he kept, and Entries of all that paſt to K. <hi>J</hi>'s Diſadvantage, that he all along intended him the Kindneſs he has now pay'd. I ſuppoſe he will not deny it. He makes no Secret of it, but plainly juſtifies it, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 20. <hi>n.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 224. <hi>Nor can any reaſonable man</hi> (ſay she) <hi>blame thoſe amongſt us who deſired or aſſiſted in this Deliverance, and to their utmoſt power laboured to procure it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One would reaſonably ask upon this, How it came to paſs that ſo very few <hi>Proteſtants</hi> loſt their Lives in <hi>Ireland</hi> under K. <hi>J.</hi> being ſo univerſally involved in Treaſon againſt him. Our Author in anſwer to this, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 179. (but it is falſly pag'd, it ought to be <hi>p.</hi> 187.) among other Reaſons, gives this for one, <hi>That they</hi> (the Proteſtants) <hi>were ſo true to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi> Which this Author repeated, and further explain'd, ſoon after the Revolution there, in a Letter to an <hi>Iriſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Biſhop then in <hi>London;</hi> wherein he ſaid, That tho it was in almoſt every Proteſtants Power to hang the reſt, yet, <hi>they were ſo true to one another</hi> they did not diſcover it. This ſhews how generally they were guilty of <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt K. J.</p>
            <p>Add to this what I have been told by Proteſtants then in <hi>Dublin,</hi> That K. <hi>J.</hi> had once ſo good an Opinion of this Author, that he had him frequently in private, and truſted him in his Affairs, till at laſt he found him out; and his old Friend the Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>Herbert</hi> was ſo far miſtaken in him, that he vouched for him at the Council-Table with ſo much zeal, as to ſay, That he was as Loyal a Man as any ſat at that Board; which did retrieve this Author from ſome Inconveniencies that then lay upon him, and continued him ſome time longer in the King's good Opinion.</p>
            <p>There is another Paſſage very ſurprizing. I know a Perſon to whom this Author wrote about <hi>Sept.</hi> 88. when the News was hot of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s intended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into <hi>England;</hi> and before the Depoſitions concerning
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59238:65"/>the P. of <hi>Wales</hi> were publiſhed; and this Author did in his Letter mightily bemoan that there was no care taken to make ſome proof of his Birth, to ſtop the Stories were every where ſpread about it, without any Anſwer to them, which made ſome give the more Credit to them. If, ſaid this Author, any thing of this ſort were done to ſatisfie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Men of the Birth of the Prince, I am confident the Church of <hi>England</hi> would once more (as in the Bill of Excluſion) venture to oppoſe the Current of the Nation, and ſtand by the Truth. Accordingly, when all this was done by the Depoſitions which were publiſhed in <hi>October,</hi> 88. we heard of no more Objections from this Author, as to the P. of W. and ſuppoſe he was ſatisfied; of which no Man could doubt, with any tollerable Charity for a Man of this Author's Character, conſidering that till the Battel of the <hi>Boyne</hi> he did acknowlege this ſame P. of W. as P. of W. in his ſolemn Addreſſes to God, in the face of the People: Nay, even after the <hi>Boyne,</hi> a Gentleman told me that this Author did mightily complain to him, That the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> had neither proved the Impoſture of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> nor the <hi>French League,</hi> with which the Nations had been ſo allarmed; and that it was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the Nation, to think to make them ſwallow theſe things without Proof. And yet, all this notwithſtanding, in his Thankſgiving Sermon, 16 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 90. for the. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory of the <hi>Boyne,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks of that <hi>League</hi> with as much Aſſurance as if he had tranſacted it himſelf, and makes it the chief head of his Declamations againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> and the great Reaſon for our Abdicating of him; a Taſte of which I have given you before: And of the P. of W. he ſays in the ſame Sermon, <hi>p.</hi> 16. <hi>That it was not ſo much as a well contrived Cheat.</hi> And, <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>We all are ſatisfied,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that this</hi> (Popiſh Contrivance) <hi>was the only Womb that conceived a</hi> P. <hi>of</hi> W. <hi>for us, and gave him a Birth.</hi> He tells us not what new Light he had got in theſe Particulars; but you ought to ſuppoſe that he was very well aſſured of them, before he brought them into the Pulpit; and yet being ſo well aſſured) as this Author himſelf perhaps, if not, others of his Brethren will tell you now) That he, with the reſt of the <hi>Dublin</hi> Clergy, pray'd daily for this <hi>ill contrived
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59238:66"/>Cheat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The groſs Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy, in Praying for K <hi>James</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </note> as P. of W. and for his Father too, That God would give him Victory over all his Enemies, when that was the thing they leaſt wiſht, and confeſs that they laboured all they could againſt it: Good God! what Apprehenſion, what Thought had theſe Men of their publick Prayers; <hi>bantring</hi> God Almighty, and <hi>mocking</hi> him to his Face, who heard their Words, and ſaw their Hearts! Is not <hi>Atheiſm</hi> a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Sin than this, ſince it is better to have no God, than to ſet up one, <hi>to laugh at him!</hi> I am not able to ſpare them in this.</p>
            <p>Before the Aſſociation in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland, Septemb.</hi> 88. they prayed for K. <hi>J.</hi> The beginning of <hi>March</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, they proclaimed the P. of O. King, and prayed for him. The 14th day King <hi>James</hi>'s Army broke their Forces at <hi>Drommore,</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and reduced all but <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Eneskillen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they prayed again for K. <hi>J.</hi> That God would <hi>ſtrengthen him to vanquiſh and overcome all his Enemies. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> following, <hi>Schomberg</hi> went over with an Engliſh Army. Then, as far as his Quarters reacht, they returned to pray the ſame Prayer for K. <hi>William;</hi> the reſt of the Proteſtants ſtill praying for Victory to K. <hi>J.</hi> and for the P. of W. and yet now they tell us, That all that while, they all meant the ſame thing; four times in one Year Praying forward and backward, point blanck contradictory to one another: And one would believe that they never thought of it, or conſidered whether it was a Fault or not: For, as if there had been no ſuch thing, they tell K. <hi>W.</hi> in their Addreſs to him, <hi>No.</hi> 26. Appendix. <hi>We do not doubt,</hi> ſay they, <hi>but God will hear the Prayers of His Church, and Crown your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Arms with Succeſs,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo they go on moſt Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to make him a Preſent of their <hi>Prayers;</hi> and aſſure his Majeſty, That, <hi>with the most hearty Importunity,</hi> they would pray for him. This, I ſuppoſe, was put in, that he might not think they would pray for him, as they did for K. <hi>J.</hi> that is, <hi>Hypocritically,</hi> and againſt their own Heart, to that Degree, that the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> in his Speech, at the head, and in the name of the <hi>Dublin</hi> Clergy, (<hi>No.</hi> 8. <hi>Append.</hi>) takes pains to clear himſelf and them to K. <hi>W.</hi> from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo much as <hi>Trimmers</hi> towards K. <hi>J.</hi> while he
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59238:66"/>was there among them; that is, they were his <hi>inveterate Enemies,</hi> [This was about a Week after this Biſhop offered his Service to K. <hi>J.</hi> to attend upon him to the <hi>Boyne.</hi>] and their Praying for him all that time was only matter of Form, to pleaſe him: <hi>It was at once both innocent and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> [to keep to the Biſhop's Words] <hi>and fit to be obſerved to a Power that was able to Cruſh us far worſe than it did.</hi> Who would ſtick out for a little <hi>praying?</hi> God knew their Heart, that they did not mean a Word of what they ſaid, even while they received the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> where they pray'd for K. <hi>J.</hi> at the very Altar, as they do now for K. <hi>W.</hi> and in the Collect after the Ten Commandments, they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege before God, <hi>That K.</hi> J. <hi>was His Miniſter, and had His Authority;</hi> and prayed for His Grace <hi>faithfully to ſerve, honour, and humbly obey King</hi> James, <hi>in God and for God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to his Bleſſed Word and Ordinance;</hi> and yet at that time they thought him not <hi>God's Miniſter,</hi> nor to have <hi>His Authority;</hi> were not reſolved, nor thought it their Duty <hi>to ſerve or obey him,</hi> nay, not ſo much as to <hi>Trimm</hi> on his ſide. They thought him not their lawful King, but that K. <hi>W.</hi> was their King, and had <hi>God's Authority;</hi> and that they were obliged to obey K. <hi>W. in God, and for God, according to God's Bleſſed Word and Ordinance,</hi> whom yet in their Addreſs to K. <hi>J.</hi> they call an <hi>unnatural Uſurper.</hi> Was there ever ſuch broad hardened Affronting God to his Face? What did theſe <hi>Divines,</hi> or others, think, when they received the Sacrament with ſuch a Lye in their Mouths? It makes ones Hair ſtand on end!</p>
            <p>O God, look not upon this, forgive the Iniquity of our holy things!</p>
            <p>Will this Method perſuade Men to have Regard to your Prayers, or your Principles?</p>
            <p>But nothing of all this touches upon our Author; he is ſtill very confident, <hi>p.</hi> 238. <hi>That they were not guilty of any ſervile or mean Compliances,</hi> or, as the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> words it, of no Compliances, but ſuch as were <hi>at once both inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and neceſſary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will our Adverſaries ſay to this Excuſe? Was it both <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> in them to abhor and deteſt K. <hi>W.</hi> (whom they thought their only true and lawful King)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59238:67"/>as an <hi>unnatural Uſurper,</hi> and all thoſe as <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> who took his part; and to plight their Faith, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe their Allegiance, as they do in the aboveſaid Addreſs of Parliament, with one Voice, Tongue and Heart, to K. <hi>J.</hi> whom they thought to be no longer their King, but to have <hi>Abdicated?</hi> And yet they did thus endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him into an intire Confidence and Dependance upon their Loyalty to him; making him a Tender of <hi>their Lives and Fortunes, againſt the ſaid Uſurper the</hi> P. <hi>of</hi> O. <hi>and his Adherents, and all other Rebels and Traytors whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe were not <hi>ſervile or mean Compliances,</hi> I deſire the Author to tell us what can be ſo? Moſt ſolemn and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Lying upon Record, in the Face of the World, and to all Poſterities! <hi>Perjury, Diſſimulation</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> to the laſt Degree; perſuading that Prince to truſt them, whom they at the ſame time were reſolved to deſtroy! And that no humane Eye ſhould diſcover them, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on their Hypocriſie, even to pray ſolemnly to God every day in their Churches, for Victory to K. <hi>J.</hi> when now they all tell us, that in their hearts they wiſht it to K. W. If to deceive Men, was neither <hi>ſervile</hi> nor <hi>mean,</hi> was it both <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> thus to mock God?</p>
            <p>Was there not (may <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay) juſt Grounds for what this Author tells of K. <hi>J. c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 20. <hi>n.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 222. That he <q>gave Advice to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Brothers, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Company of Proteſtants; but above all, ſays this Author, he forbad them converſing with the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergymen; for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>they are all falſe to me, and will pervert you to Diſloyalty and Treaſon.</hi>
               </q> This the Author calls loading the Proteſtants with the moſt odious Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Miſrepreſentations. But ſuppoſe K. <hi>J.</hi> or any of his Friends, ſhould ask this Author, whether one Word of it was falſe? Will he ſay that they were true to K. <hi>J.</hi> or did pray ſincerely for him what they daily repeated in their Common Prayers? And conſequently that they gave no manner of Ground, but were perfectly innocent of the Charge with which this Author ſays the Papiſts loaded them, viz <hi>That they had no Religion at all; that they only pretended to it, but were Atheiſts and Traytors in their Hearts?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59238:67"/>It is true indeed they treated K. <hi>J.</hi> with all imaginable Demonſtrations of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> (but how ſincere themſelves will tell you now) wherever he came the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> were the firſt to make their Court. He Landed on Tueſday the 12th of <hi>March</hi> 1689, at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> next Morning the Vicar, Mr. <hi>Thoms,</hi> went to the Fort to kiſs His Majeſty's Hand, being introduc'd by the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as he tells in his Journal; and, ſays he, on Thurſday the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> we came to <hi>Cork,</hi> and lodg'd at the Biſhop's Palace, and I brought the Biſhop and the Clergy to the King, who receiv'd them very kindly. Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 15th I went with the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> to the King's <hi>Levee,</hi> and tarried at Court till I ſaw the Rebels of <hi>Bandon</hi> at His Feet, and the <hi>Miniſter</hi> in an Elegant Speech begging their Pardon, which he granted them. And the Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> conſtantly attended at the King's <hi>Levee,</hi> while His Majeſty ſtay'd there. Friday the 22d of <hi>March,</hi> K. <hi>J.</hi> came to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> where the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> to kiſs His Majeſty's Hand, who received them very graciouſly. Sunday the 24th the King came to <hi>Dublin.</hi> Monday the 25th (1689) Primate <hi>Boyle,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> adviſed the Biſhop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> to accept of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cloghor</hi> then void: which was owning K. <hi>J.</hi> to have had at that time full right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it, and conſequently to be Rightful King. But that was fully and abſolutely owned, in ample form, on Wedneſday the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> 1689, by the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> and <hi>Proctor</hi> of the Univerſity, in the Name, and at the Head of the Body of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Univerſity.</hi> The Biſhop printed his Speech, and is inſerted, <hi>No.</hi> 8 <hi>Append.</hi> But the <hi>Proctor,</hi> thô commanded by the King to print his Speech, modeſtly declined it, he was more cautious, and conſidered, that it was framed only for that Juncture, and is very well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that we have it not now to print with the Biſhop's. Tueſday the 2d of <hi>April,</hi> 1689, K. <hi>J.</hi> told the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> that complaint was made to him, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>Dublin</hi> did not readily pray for the Prince of <hi>VVales</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Notice the <hi>Dublin-Clergy</hi> met, and conſulted, and thô they did not believe the reality of the Prince of <hi>VVales,</hi> yet they reſolved the King ſhould not have that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59238:68"/>Pretence againſt them, they would truſt themſelves in the Hand of God rather than Man, preſume <hi>Deliberately</hi> to act the Hypocrite with God, and pray againſt their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rather than diſpleaſe the King. But enough of this before.</p>
            <p>There is another thing: Not one of theſe <hi>complying Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> but will freely acknowledge, That if K. <hi>VV.</hi> or any other King ſhould turn <hi>Papiſt,</hi> and do all that K. <hi>J.</hi> has done, they wou'd and ought to ſerve him as they did K. <hi>J.</hi> They cannot otherwiſe juſtifie their Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards K. <hi>J.</hi> The conſideration of this made the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>England</hi> aboliſh that Declaration, <hi>viz. That it is not lawful, upon any pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But this, by ſome neglect, is left ſtill upon the <hi>Iriſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Clergy,</hi> under the Penalty of forfeiting their Livings. And as many as have come into any Livings ſince this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, have read the ſaid Declaration publickly in time of <hi>Divine Service;</hi> and are to continue ſo to do, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they will do it, till ſome Parliament take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. This will be called as groſs a mocking of God, as their former praying for K.<hi>J.</hi> that is, whether they <hi>believe,</hi> or do <hi>not belive</hi> that Declaration. If they <hi>believe</hi> it, they condemn themſelves in taking Arms againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> If they do <hi>not belive</hi> it, they make it viſible to all the World, That there is no Tye or Obligation, <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Sacred,</hi> can touch their Conſciences, when they ſo <hi>Solemnly,</hi> while they are Officiating in the Divine Service, and offering up to God the Prayers of their Flocks, dare, at that very time, and with the ſame Breath, declare before <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>People,</hi> that they do believe it, when they do not belive it, and the People know that they do not believe it: For they make no Secret of it, will tell every one that asks them; nay they ſtay not to be asked, they <hi>Preach</hi> againſt it, and <hi>Diſpute</hi> againſt it, and <hi>Inſtruct</hi> their Congregations againſt it, and would call any one a <hi>Jacobite</hi> and a <hi>Papiſt</hi> who durſt own it, and hunt him to the next <hi>Goal.</hi> And, yet to ſave their Livings, they continue ſtill to ſubſcribe this <hi>hated</hi> Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before their Ordinaries, and take Certificates under their Hands and Seals, that they have done it (as they are
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59238:68"/>obliged by the Act) and publickly and openly Read the ſame upon the Lord's Day, in their Pariſh Churches where they Officiate, in the preſence of the Congregation there Aſſembled, in the time of Divine Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They <hi>Read</hi> it in the <hi>Desk,</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> againſt it in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and when they come out of Church rail at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that Impoſed it, and ſay, That it was ſoon after the Reſtauration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660. when People were Drunk with Loyalty, after being wearied with the direful Effects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion under all its ſpecious Pretences; and thought they could never run far enough from it, till they run to the quite contrary Extreme, and advanc'd <hi>Prerogative</hi> to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>And they Wonder, and Curſe the hard Fate, that this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> was not taken out of the way in <hi>Ireland</hi> as well as in <hi>England,</hi> and wiſh it were done. But in the mean time they will loſe nothing by it, they can ſwallow— and it will ſwallow them, if they do not Repent. God grant them Grace to do it: And that the Shame of this their Sin may <hi>Convent,</hi> and not <hi>Harden</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But this Charge is general: Our Author is only involved in it with many others.

That there was no way to preſerve the Honor of our Religion, but by adhering unalterably to our <hi>Loyalty.</hi> That it would be a glorious Sight to ſee a Cart full of Clergy-men go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Stake for <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> as the Primitive Chriſtians did. That it would prove the Support and Glory of our Religion, but that a <hi>Rebellion</hi> would ruine
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59238:69"/>and diſgrace it. He ſaid if it were no more than that <hi>Declaration</hi> which he had Subſcribed, of <hi>Its not being law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon any pretence whatſoever to take Arms againſt the King,</hi> &amp;c. he would dye a Hundred Deaths rather than do it.</q> At a Meeting of the <hi>Clergy of Dublin,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of this Revolution in 88. to conſider what Meaſures they were to take; he declared, <hi>That their taking Arms in the</hi> North <hi>of</hi> Ireland, <hi>at that time, was</hi> Rank Rebellion, <hi>if there could be any</hi> Rebellion; <hi>particularly</hi> Derry <hi>ſhutting their Gates againſt the King's Forces ſent thither:</hi> And when one there preſent did affirm, That the Subjects might take Arms in Defence of their Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Author did violently oppoſe it, even in relation to <hi>Derry,</hi> and urged that the Biſhop of <hi>Derry (Hopkins)</hi> who was then there, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt their ſhutting out the King's Forces, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to joyn with thoſe who did it; for which, and other Reaſons, this Author then gave, he was againſt any Bodies going to the <hi>North,</hi> or joyning with <hi>them,</hi> as being a joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the Year 86. or 87. After his going from <hi>Wexford</hi> Waters to ſeveral of the Biſhops of <hi>Munſter,</hi> he wrote a Letter to a Perſon of undoubted Credit, giving an Account of what happened in his Journey, and of the Subſtance of what he Diſcourſed with the Biſhops of <hi>Waterford, Corke,</hi> and <hi>Cloyne;</hi> he wrote, <q>That, among other things, he adviſed them (as the only way to prevent the Dangers that were imminent) to a ſteaddineſs in their <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and that he aſſerted, that if the King and our Temporal Governors ſhould enact unjuſt Laws, that the Subject has no Remedy but Patience, againſt whom we allow no other Weapons but Prayers and Tears; and that it was a moſt unlawful thing for any to call in a <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Force,</hi> or erect a New Government to redreſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Laws: And adds, That it is a ſad thing that it is not obſerved that <hi>Rebellions</hi> in the <hi>State,</hi> and <hi>Schiſme</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> ariſe from this one Principle; to wit, That Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may <hi>in ſome Caſes reſiſt,</hi> or <hi>ſeperate</hi> from their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Governors ſet over them by God: Whereas the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Non Reſiſtance</hi> is a ſteady Principle of Loyalty, and it will be found no eaſier Matter to ſhake either the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59238:69"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> that is ſettled on it. <hi>And he repeats it again,</hi> That it is intolerable for the Members of any State to flee to <hi>Foreign Succors,</hi> out of Pretence, that their own Governors have made Laws againſt Reaſon, Conſcience and Juſtice; and fooliſh to allege in their Defence, <hi>That all Mankind is of one Blood, and bound to help one another.</hi>
               </q> [Which now he has made his great Argument in this Book, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5]</p>
            <p>What is above-written, I have from the Perſon to whom he wrote it, and more to the ſame purpoſe; and if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it, his Letters ſhall be produced.</p>
            <p>The ſame Perſon told me that about the beginning of this Revolution he was in Company with the Author, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentleman (I think it was Dr. <hi>Dun</hi>) who blamed the preaching of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> ſo high, as the cauſe of what had befallen us; whom this Author ſmartly reproved, and vindicated the Doctrine of Paſſive Obedience <hi>to the highth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that Zeal and Courage has left him with his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or while he counterfeits his Principles, [there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of aſſurance in defending ſome Cauſes] which makes him now ſhun all thoſe who knew his former Principles, and have not changed as well as himſelf: He refuſed to ſee, all the time he was in <hi>London</hi> laſt <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> a Deprived Biſhop, with whom he was as intimate as any Man, and had contracted a great Friendſhip: and when he was minded of it to ſee his Old Friend, he would not, ſaid they ſhould fall into Heats. And beginning of this laſt <hi>October</hi> 1692, being in <hi>Oxford,</hi> on his Road to <hi>Ireland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> of <hi>Univerſity-College</hi> was with this Author in the Schools-Quadrangle, at the very time Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> his admired Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance was going up to the Library, and Mr. <hi>Hudſon</hi> asking whether he ſhould call after him, our Author forbad him, ſaying, <hi>He knew</hi> Mr. Dodwell <hi>would be angry with him.</hi> If he thought that Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> was in an Error, he ought to have endeavoured to convince him. No, he knew that Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> ſtood upon the ſame Ground where he left him: and that it was he himſelf had Prevaricated, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken his firſt Love, and therefore was aſhamed to meet with the Man who knew his Principles ſo well before, and who had ſtuck cloſe to them in the Day of Tryal. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59238:70"/>ſight of ſuch a Man is an upbraiding of their Cowardiſe and Unconſtancy who have deſerted their Principles, and raiſes Guilt in their Faces which their Eyes would diſcover, though they were hardened againſt a Bluſh.</p>
            <q>—Heu quantum mutatus ab illo!</q>
            <p>From the well reputed and deſerving Dr. <hi>K.</hi> who honoured and admired, and loved Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> above moſt Men, would have gone far to ſee him, and was proud of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding with him! and now ſhuns his ſight, as Guilty Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners would the Face of Heaven! O, if this Author had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Integrity, how much greater would he have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Friendſhip, Eſteem, and Fellow-Suffering of this Great Man, then in his Guilty Purple? But Deſerters muſt ſhew their Zeal, and diſcover their own Shame.</p>
            <p>Behold now how he ſtarts, and quotes it as a full Proof of King <hi>James</hi>'s Arbitrary Deſigns, That it was Enacted in their Act of Recognition in <hi>Ireland, That the Deciſion, in all Caſes of a miſuſed Authority by a Lawful Hereditary King, muſt be left to the ſole judgment of God.</hi> Indeed, I was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee him quote this as ſo ſtrange a thing, which is over and over to be found in the Acts both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> as if he had not only <hi>forſaken,</hi> but quite <hi>forgot</hi> what he had formerly taught. He has got new Principles and a new Language, <hi>p.</hi> 182. (it ought to be 190. for it is falſe Printed,) he ſays K. <hi>J.</hi> was <hi>ungrateful</hi> to the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtant Clergy:</hi> This is very <hi>familiar;</hi> but what was the King's <hi>Ingratitude?</hi> Becauſe, if they had been diſloyal in <hi>Monmouth</hi> or <hi>Argile</hi>'s Rebellion, they might have made an Inſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this Author thinks the King is in their Debt for not <hi>Rebelling.</hi> And I ſuppoſe this is all the way that they brought him to the Throne, as this Author ſays in the ſame place.</p>
            <p>It ſeems theſe <hi>Iriſh Clergy</hi> have been mighty Men, and we have not known it. But he ſays that by their Zeal for King <hi>James,</hi> they loſt the Affections of their People. This is a Scandal, I verily believe, upon the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants:</hi> They were, I hope, better Men; I have known ſome of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59238:70"/>them, and this Author ought to know them better. I have not heard that any of the Iriſh Proteſtants took Offence at that Paſſage which this Author Printed in the Preface to a Sermon of the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Kilmore</hi>'s, preached in the Author's Church of St. <hi>Warborrough</hi>'s in <hi>Dublin,</hi> in <hi>March,</hi> 1684. the firſt year of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign: It was enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Confeſſion of Faith:</hi> There, in a Letter of this Author's to the Lord Biſhop, which is Printed in the Preface, he avers poſitively in theſe words, <hi>viz. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any one of our Communion to be diſloyal without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This paſt better with the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants,</hi>

               </note> than that <hi>Super-Loyal</hi> Strain of our famous Dr. <hi>Tillotſon</hi> (which he Preached before the King at <hi>Whitehall, Apr.</hi> 2. 1680. upon <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24.15. did pleaſe the <hi>Church of</hi> England-<hi>men</hi> here, other than thoſe who took the Court for the Standard of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The Paſſage is, Pag. 11. &amp; Sect. 2. of the Sermon; where the Doctor, in profound Adoration of the Royal Authority, and the Legal Eſtabliſhment of a Nation, makes it unlawful to preach againſt the eſtabliſhed Religion of a Nation, (though it be falſe) unleſs we could juſtifie our Commiſſion by <hi>Miracles,</hi> as the Apoſtles did. <q>All, ſays he, that Perſons of a different Religion can in ſuch a Caſe reaſonably pretend to, is to enjoy the private Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Exerciſe of their own Conſcience and Religion; for which they ought to be very thankful, <hi>[becauſe, by the way it is impoſſible for any Government to hinder any Man from the private Exerciſe of his own Conſcience and Religion,]</hi> and to forbear the open making of Proſelytes to their own Religion, (though they be never ſo ſure that they are in the right,) till they have <hi>an extraordinary Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God to that purpoſe.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, becauſe ſome do think That that extraordinary Commiſſion, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19, 20 <hi>Go teach all Nations</hi>—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles <hi>to the end of the World,</hi> to which time Chriſt there promiſes to aſſiſt this Commiſſion of his, and to be with thoſe who preach it, therefore the Dr. barrs that Pretence in what is ſaid above; for he not only requires That ſuch Men ſhould be <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Commiſſioned, as the Apoſtles and firſt Publiſhers of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59238:71"/>the Goſpel were,</hi> but that they be able to <hi>ſuſtifie that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion by</hi> Miracles, <hi>as they did.</hi> This indeed does ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſecure any People from being diſturbed with the hearing of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or ony other Religion, but that wherein they were bred, till a new Age of <hi>Miracles</hi> ſhall ariſe.</p>
            <p>If our Author had gon to this length of Paſſive Obedience, I ſhould not wonder that ſome <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; for it did not reliſh with us here, notwithſtanding the good Dr. was at the pains to print it twice for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.<note place="margin">

But when Religion, <hi>ſays he, p.</hi> 19. once comes to ſupplant Moral Righteouſneſs— to lye for the Truth, and to kill Men for God's ſake; when it ſeems to no other purpoſe, but to be a Bond of Conſpiracy, to inflame the Tempers of Men to a greater fierceneſs, and to ſet a keener edge upon their Spirits— then ſurely it loſes its Nature, and ceaſes to be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</q>

            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed that the Chriſtian Religion is the moſt conducive to promote <hi>Temporal</hi> Peace, and good <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of any thing in the World: But we have been taught (and I hope it is true) that it has much more Spiritual and greater Ends than theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal Happineſs in

But, good Sir, if you would give me leave, Does not <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity</hi> lead to <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation?</hi> And that is a little worſe, I humbly conceive, than any Imbroylments in this World, that were ever cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for Religion, even that of <hi>Joſhua</hi> among the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites;</hi> which, by all the Arguments in this Sermon, was an attempt contrary to the Nature of true Religion, and muſt have byaſt all who look no farther than <hi>Temporal Quiet</hi> againſt <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Religion, and to embrace rather that of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who acted only on the <hi>Defenſive</hi> But I will not be ſo unjuſt to this learned Dr. as to conceal the Strength of his Argument. That <hi>Hell</hi> is worſe than <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſturbance,</hi> does indeed carry the Vogue among un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking People; and conſequently they do ſuppoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Dr. that Atheiſm and Infidelity are worſe than the Diſturbance of our Quiet here. But he has taken pains to inſtruct them in his Sermon Preached before the Queen, 7 <hi>March</hi> 90. upon <hi>Matt</hi> 25.46. and Printed <hi>By their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſpecial Command;</hi> That all God's Threatnings of <hi>Hell</hi> may be only <hi>in Terrorem,</hi> to <hi>Frighten</hi> Men; but that there is no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> nor <hi>Certainty</hi> that Hell will be <hi>Eternal,</hi> as is threatned, or that there will be any Hell at all: But a leſs threat than that of Eternal Puniſhment, he ſays, is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to deter Men from Sin: And therefore that God did wiſely to threaten it: But the Dr. (to prevent God from Deceiving of Mankind) has told this great Secret.

            <p>Now before we part with theſe Gentlemen, I would earneſtly deſire them to anſwer me (with the ſame Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with which they addreſſed <hi>to one</hi> or <hi>both</hi> of theſe Kings) Whether it King <hi>James</hi> had ſuceeded at the <hi>Boyne,</hi> and been then re-eſtabliſhed in <hi>England,</hi> they would have put that Comment upon their Speech to him which they did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in their Speech to K. <hi>W?</hi> And whether if any Man ſhould have charged them for meaning it with that Reſerve, they would not have called it a baſe Calumny, and <hi>ſworn</hi> to the contrary, if K <hi>J.</hi> had required it, at leaſt if an Act of Parliament had been made to have <hi>Deprived them if they did not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ask again, Whether they would have confeſt, as now they do, that they did not mean ſincerely in what they Prayed for K. <hi>James, viz.</hi> That <hi>God would give him ſtrength to vanquiſh and overcome all his Enemies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay farther, Whether they would not have boaſted of their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>ſincere</hi> Intentions towards King <hi>James,</hi> and reproached thoſe of Disaffection to Him, who had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Him, and of quitting the true Principles of <hi>the Church of England?</hi> and that they were ready to ſuffer not only much more than they did, but even <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf, without Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or Reviling, much leſs Reſiſting <hi>the Lord's Anointed,</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:59238:73"/>according to the Command of Scripture, the Practice of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians, and the expreſs Doctrine of our <hi>Homilies, &amp;c.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The Behaviour of the Clergy in taking the Oaths.</note>This has been remarkably fulfilled in this Revolution; but eſpecially in the <hi>Clergy.</hi> There never was ſo ſudden and ſo ſhameful a Turn of Men profeſſing Religion; and the manner of doing it ſo impolitick, as to make it evident they took the Oaths with at leaſt a <hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>ſcrupalous</hi> Conſcience, (the Sentence of which they may read <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.) for they did not take them <hi>freely,</hi> but haggled, and kept off, ſome to the laſt day, roaring againſt them all the while, and then coming about all at once, with new coyn'd <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> point blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the declared Senſe of the Impoſers. They dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered among themſelves; every one had a particular <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi> for his own Conſcience. Some pretend they keep to <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> ſtill; others, that they were never for it. It is a ſevere Jeſt that the Common People have got up againſt the Clergy, That there was but one thing formerly which the Parliament could not do, that is, to make a Man a Woman: But now there is another, that is, to make an Oath <hi>which the</hi> Clergy <hi>will not take.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, they have ſhewn ſuch Unwillingneſs, ſuch poor pittiful mean Arts, to <hi>ſhift,</hi> to <hi>compound,</hi> to <hi>accommodate</hi> this Oath to their Intereſts, that K. <hi>W.</hi> has no reaſon to truſt them nor their Oaths. They will find a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> to leave him, if ever they can make their Account by it. But no doubt he underſtands them.</p>

                  </gap>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Clergy.</note>I will not enter upon the Caſe of the <hi>Deprived Clergy;</hi> only ſay this, That their Firmneſs to what the People think to have been the uncontroverted Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> has kept many Men from rank Atheiſm, and believing all Religion to be really
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59238:74"/>no more than <hi>Prieſtcraft,</hi> and a mere Cheat: while they ſee <hi>Divines</hi> turn for a piece of Bread, and damn that to day, which they enjoyned yeſterday upon pain of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But on the other hand, when they find ſo many, and the greateſt of them, part with all they have in the World, Honours, Eſtates, and ready, as they have given good Reaſon to believe, to lay down their very <hi>Lives</hi> in adhering to thoſe Principles which they have preacht; this forces People to reflect that theſe Men are in earneſt with Religion, and that there may be ſuch a thing. For the greateſt Danger to which we are now expoſed, by this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of ſo many of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> is not only <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Phanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,</hi> whoſe Principles they have embrac'd, but a contempt of <hi>all Religion,</hi> which is now ſpread over the Land, in a manner unheard of in former Ages. The Lord avert this ſad <hi>Omen!</hi> and grant us Repentance to prevent his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for Chriſt Jeſus ſake.</p>
            <p>This is a ſad Subject, to look upon the Nakedneſs and Reproach of ſo many who were once Members of that Renowned Church of <hi>England!</hi> Let us turn our Eyes to ſome leſs afflicting Proſpect.</p>

            <p>I go not abroad, nor meddle with the <hi>Confederacie</hi> of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. the Emperor, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other <hi>Roman Catholick Princes,</hi> to ſet up a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Prince againſt a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> King, who has no other Crime laid to his Charge, by our Author's own Confeſſion, than what he calls the natural Effects of Popery: And for this, Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Armed Papiſts came to diſpoſſeſs him!</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, That <hi>Religion</hi> was not the only Quarrel, <hi>and we eaſily believe it.</hi> It has the leaſt ſhare in our Quarrels, though it is always made the Pretence.

You ſee I am left alone, I have none to do any thing for me.</hi> But above all, ſome of them moving to him for leave to cut off the Proteſtants, which he return'd with Indignation and Amazement, ſaying, <hi>What, Gentlemen, are you for another Forty-One?</hi> Which ſo gall'd them, that they ever after look'd upon him with a jealous Eye, and thought him, thô a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> too much an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> to carry on their Buſineſs. And I am told by perſons come from thence, That the generality of the <hi>Irish Papiſts</hi> do at this day lay all their Misfortunes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on K. <hi>J.</hi> becauſe he would not follow their Meaſures, and was ſo inclinable to favour the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, their <hi>Surrender,</hi> or <hi>Selling</hi> of <hi>Limerick</hi> (as ſome ſay, but I know nothing of it) but this is certain, that they were well able to have held out till the <hi>French</hi> Succors could have come: And ſome of theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> have ſince been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by K. <hi>VV.</hi> and have found their Account in the Articles granted them, and made no ſcruple to take the Oath of Allegiance to K. <hi>VV.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> which is agreed to in the Articles of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and now taken generally by the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> all over <hi>Ireland,</hi> by direction of <hi>their Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi> But theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> for got that it was chiefly upon their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59238:75"/>by ſhewing favour to <hi>them,</hi> that K. <hi>J.</hi> brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf all his Misfortunes. Putting <hi>them</hi> into Power, and diſplacing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to make room for <hi>them,</hi> made more noiſe, and rais'd K. <hi>J.</hi> more Enemies, than all the other Male-adminiſtrations charg'd upon his Government put together.</p>
            <p>But when ſome of them ſaw that he could no longer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them their own Eſtates, or give them thoſe of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> they gave over His Cauſe, and found no difficulty to ſwear to another Prince, though a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of K. <hi>J</hi>'s Crown.</p>
            <p>It was not much better they ſerv'd his <hi>Father;</hi> firſt brought him under Calumny for pretended Kindneſſes to <hi>them</hi> and <hi>their Religion;</hi> counterfeited Commiſſions under his Name, (which Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal</hi> confeſs'd at his Death) and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to caſt the Odium of their Rebellion and Maſſacre upon Him: And after, when they made a ſhew to return to their Loyalty, they diſappointed him of the Succors they had agreed to ſend him againſt the Rebels in <hi>England,</hi> joyn'd with the Pope's <hi>Nuncio</hi> againſt him, and invited over a Foreign Prince, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to Rule over them.</p>
            <p>I have heard ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> attribute their ill Succeſs in the Rebellion of 41. to the barbarous <hi>Maſſacres</hi> by which they began it, and their unfaithful dealing with K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. And ſome of the ſobereſt among them now do make the Reflection, That their ill Uſage of K. <hi>James</hi> II. when he came among them, (ſacrificing his Intereſt to the carrying on of their own Deſigns) did juſtly deſerve that Judgment which fell upon them in the Iſſue of that War.</p>
            <p>We have done with <hi>their</hi> Loyalty; at leaſt their Mouths are ſtopt againſt the Defection of ſo many of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Of the Roman Catholicks of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>And I think the Roman Catholicks of <hi>England</hi> too are not to inſult: For though the Oaths be not come to them, and therefore we cannot ſay certainly whether they will <hi>Swear</hi> or not, yet there lies this againſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> in their publick Chapels here in <hi>London,</hi> they pray for K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>M.</hi> which ſome of their Communion told me.</p>
            <p>I hear that all the <hi>Proteſtant Non-Jurors</hi> ſay, There is the ſame Argument againſt <hi>praying</hi> as <hi>ſwearing:</hi> And of all
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59238:75"/>their number, none did allow himſelf to <hi>pray</hi> but Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> alone, who, as he tells in the Preface to his <hi>Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſtood <hi>ſingle</hi> among the <hi>Non-ſwearing</hi> Clergy upon this account; and you ſee he did not ſtay with them. But the ſame Principle that led him to <hi>pray,</hi> brought him to <hi>ſwear</hi> too, rather than ſtick out. Therefore let not theſe Roman Catholicks be high-minded, becauſe others have fallen, but rather fear leſt having gone already Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s length of <hi>Praying,</hi> they may come to <hi>Swear</hi> like him, if they ſhould be pinch'd as he was: Nay, I have heard ſeveral of them argue for the Lawfulneſs of it, only they would keep from it as long as they could. I ſay not that this does conclude upon others who do not ſo; but it may make them more modeſt in rejoycing over our Fall.</p>

               <note place="margin">Non-Jurors of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>Upon the whole, I muſt ſay, That there are none have cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly ſtuck to the Principles they profeſs'd, but the <hi>Non-jurors</hi> of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For, as they profeſs'd them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, in the ſame ſenſe they have ſtuck to them now; and have given that demonſtration of their being in earneſt, that they are content to loſe all, rather than deviate from them.</p>
            <p>And this is one Diſcovery, among the reſt, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution has made: It has diſcovered the inflexible Loyalty of theſe Men, whom neither perſonal Injuries, nor Attempts upon their <hi>Religion, Liberty</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> can move from that Duty to the King which they think a Principle of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and this is a high Vindication of their Religion, and a Recommendation of it. But now we are upon the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, let us not forget to do Juſtice to all. We cannot forget the Riſe and Source of our Diſeaſe, whence all theſe Evils we now feel and foreſee, have come upon us; and that is our wicked <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Rebellion againſt K.

            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:59238:76"/>God often in his All-wiſe Providence ſuffers Rebellion to bring on thoſe ſame Evils, for prevention of which we choſe to Rebell; as the <hi>Jews</hi> crucified Chriſt, leſt the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould come;<note place="margin">

               </note>But there are many other Particulars, beſides thoſe to which I have ſpoken, wherein the Author ſhews great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of prevarication: And tho he pretends to ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, which any one would believe by his Method, yet it is viſible that he ſet down things <hi>at random,</hi> meerly for want of pains to examin them.</p>
            <p>C. 3. S. 12. <hi>at the end, p.</hi> 165. he pretends to compute what the Eſtates of all the <hi>Jacobites</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> are worth. But this may paſs more innocently than where it reflects upon any particular Perſons Reputation; in theſe Caſes, it is not only uncharitable, but unjuſt, to ſay any thing at a venture. If we know not the thing to be true, we are to err on the charitable ſide, and not mention what may reflect upon another: but if we do, we muſt be ſure to ſet down our Vouchers, ſo as to leave no umbrage to ſuſpect the Truth. This our Author, I am afraid, has not ſo punctually obſerved through all this Book, particularly in the Characters which he takes upon him to give of ſo many perſons. C. 3. S. 3. he accuſes the Judges, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Nugent, ibid. n</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 61. of down-right Bribery, <hi>That he went ſharer in Cauſes before him, and not only appeared for them on the Bench, but alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly encouraged and fomented them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have heard others ſay, who are no Admirers of that Judge, That they are confident this is a rank Slander and Calumny; and that no ſuch thing can be proved againſt him. However, an Accuſation of ſo heinous a Nature ought not to have been exhibited, eſpecially in Print, without ſome Proofs along with it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Nugent,</hi> ſays the Author, <hi>was pitch'd on by K.</hi> J. <hi>to judge whether the Outlawries againſt his Father and his Fellow
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59238:77"/>Rebels ſhould be reverſed.</hi> Now I am aſſur'd, That his Father, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of <hi>Weſtmeath</hi> was not Outlawed; which if ſo, this is ſuch another careleſs Miſtake as this Author makes, <hi>ibid. n.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 60. where he calls <hi>Felix O Neil</hi> (a Maſter of Chancery in King <hi>James</hi>'s time) <hi>Son of Turlogh O Neil the great Rebel in</hi> 41, <hi>and Maſſacrer of the Proteſtants.</hi> That <hi>Turlogh O Neil</hi> was Brother to the Famous Sir <hi>Phelom O Neil,</hi> and was not Father to this <hi>Felix O Neil.</hi>

            <p>I have been told by Men of <hi>Ireland,</hi> That this <hi>Felix O Neil</hi>'s Father's Name was <hi>Phelom;</hi> and that he was ſo far from being a bloody Maſacrer in 41. that he was civil to the Proteſtants in thoſe times, particularly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>But as to the Reverſing of theſe <hi>Outlawries,</hi> this Author has not done right to K. <hi>J.</hi> For upon the Repreſentation made to his Majeſty by the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> then Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the ill Conſequences of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of theſe Outlawries, particularly the Jealouſie it gave of encroaching upon the Acts of Settlement, (which you will ſee more at large in King <hi>James</hi>'s Letter of the Third of <hi>May,</hi> 86. to the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips proceedings thereupon, which are hereunto annexed, <hi>No.</hi> 20) His Majeſty did not preſs that matter any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo there was a ſtop put to theſe Reverſals, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Government of my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for any thing I can hear, afterwards, till this Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that this ſeems rather an Impoſition upon the K.

            <p>To this Claſs will juſtly belong what I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of this Author's bold and poſitive Politicks upon foreign Princes and States, and likewiſe of the P. of <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>This Author is the firſt <hi>Iriſh Proteſtant</hi> I have heard give my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> an ill word as to his Government in <hi>Ireland.</hi> On the contrary, they all ſpeak exceeding things of him, particularly of his Zeal and Pains for Supporting the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> in that Kingdom; which gain'd their hearts to as great a degree, if not more than moſt Chief Governours had ever been there; they never parted with any Chief Governour with ſo much regret: and, as I have been told, none courted him more when he was there, than this Author, who was admitted one of his Excellency's Chaplains; but now thinks fit that ſhould be forgotten, at leaſt kept for a more ſeaſonable Juncture</p>
            <p>But <hi>C</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 4 <hi>n.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 19. he has an <hi>Inuendo</hi> of a higher Nature than this: It imports no leſs than that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants

            <p>I ſuppoſe none will deny but K. C. 2. at his Reſtauration in the year 1660. to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> had thereby a good Title to <hi>Ireland:</hi> But this Author plainly inſinuates as if the <hi>Engliſh Rebels</hi> who <hi>Conquer'd Ireland,</hi> as he calls it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Oliver,</hi> had thereby gained a Right to it for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and therefore makes it not a <hi>Duty,</hi> but a meer Act of <hi>Generoſity</hi> in them, to call home K.

            <p>But has not this Author's Intelligence brought him the News yet of the Deprivation of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and other Engliſh Biſhops and Clergy, with a greater Number in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who have loſt the whole of their Eſtates, and it is believed would lay down their Lives too for what they think to be their Duty to their King: And there are many <hi>Lay-Jacobites</hi> as reſolute even as they.

And that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Worceſter</hi> aſſerted it upon their Death-beds; and that they would have gone to the Stake, rather than have forſaken their <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> or taken the <hi>preſent Oaths.</hi> How is it poſſible that a Man ſo well read as the Author, in the Primitive Perſecutions, ſhould think loſing but half ones Eſtate ſo mighty a Matter, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the Principles of our Religion?</p>
            <p>But theſe things we can better hear, than where he would impoſe upon us ſuch <hi>Incredible</hi> Stories as would not paſs at a Country Wake.<note place="margin">

            <p>It is almoſt as ſtrange as this, what he tells, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 8. <hi>p.</hi> 138. That Colonel <hi>Luttrel,</hi> Governor of <hi>Dublin,</hi> condemned Mr. <hi>Piercy,</hi> a Merchant, to be hanged, for ſaying <hi>(very calmly) That he was not willing to part with his Goods, if he could help it:</hi> And as ſtrange that Mr. <hi>Piercy</hi> ſhould eſcape, becauſe the Governour could not find any of the <hi>Provoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you can hardly believe that Mr. <hi>Piercy</hi> ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ſpeaking ſuch innocent words, and that <hi>very calmly,</hi> you will be no Proſelyte to this Author, who as confidently, and with as little Voucher, that is, none at all, tells in the ſame place, That Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> a Proteſtant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, was <hi>confined to cloſe Priſon, and no body allowed to ſpeak to him,</hi> for— I would have the Reader gueſs the Crime, leſs, if it could be, than that of Mr. <hi>Piercy.</hi>—It was without <hi>any Crime</hi> ſo much as <hi>alledged</hi> againſt him, ſays our Author.

            <p>There is ſuſpicion in the very look of this Story; there muſt be ſomething elſe in it: Reader, then, take the truth of it thus; This <hi>Bell</hi> was not only permitted, but encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by K. <hi>J.</hi> to purſue his Trade, had Paſports and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards granted him, and particular Favours, and had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Returns from <hi>France,</hi> whereby he feather'd his Wing ſo well, that he grew Richer than ever before. I have heard ſome ſay that he got to the value of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> while K. <hi>J.</hi> was in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and to expreſs his ſenſe of the Favours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had received from K. <hi>J.</hi> and his Officers, in <hi>Sept.</hi> 90. after K. <hi>W.</hi> had riſen from before <hi>Limerick,</hi> he made a Treat for <hi>Buno Talbot</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> one of the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of the Revenue in <hi>Ireland</hi> to K. <hi>J.</hi> at the <hi>Dukes Head</hi> in <hi>Damas-ſtreet, Dublin,</hi> in acknowledgment of K. <hi>J</hi>'s Grace, and Mr. <hi>Talbot</hi>'s with others of K. <hi>J</hi>'s Officers Kindneſs,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59238:80"/>and many Civilities to him, which he abundantly teſtified before ſeveral Proteſtants then in the Company; from ſome of whom I have this. Yet this Author ſays, <hi>ibid.</hi> That K. <hi>J.</hi> would not ſuffer the Proteſtants to Trade; and when they brought any Goods from <hi>France, they were ſeiz'd, and put into the hands of Papiſts, to be diſpoſed of by them, and the right Owners not ſuffered ſo much as to oblige a Friend with a little Salt, or a Rundlet of Brandy. Thus Mr.</hi> Bell <hi>was ſerved,</hi> ſays our Author; and that the only reaſon of his Impriſonment was, <hi>that he might think no more of Trading.</hi> But this Author being ſo well acquainted with Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> and one of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal and Directors in <hi>Dublin,</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to know ſomething of his <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Trading;</hi> He might have told us the whole Truth, if he had pleaſed; which was, That Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> being thus encouraged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by K. <hi>J.</hi> made uſe of it to betray him all that was in his power. In order to which, he propoſed to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty a method of ſending what Diſpatches he thought fit into <hi>Scotland;</hi> which was, to grant <hi>Bell</hi> a Licenſe to ſend a Ship with Goods thither; and he having Friends and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondents there, it would paſs unſuſpected: and he would undertake to convey any Meſſenger ſafe His Majeſty ſhould ſend, and had contrived a private place in his Ship for Papers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if a Search ſhould be made. The King truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Integrity of the Man, gave him the Licenſe he deſired, and ſent one Mr. <hi>Strauchan</hi> in his Ship, with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches to ſeveral of His Friends. Mr. <hi>Bell</hi> having thus ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his vertuous Deſign, wrote immediately to his Correſpondent in <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> to whom the Goods were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, acquainting him with Mr. <hi>Strauchan</hi>'s coming from K. <hi>J.</hi> and what part of the Veſſel the Papers were hid in, and deſired him to ſend this Account to the Council; which accordingly he did, and ſent in Mr. <hi>Bell</hi>'s Letter, which was read publickly at the Council-board; upon which, Mr. <hi>Strauchan</hi> was apprehended, and all his Papers ſeiz'd, and the Perſons to whom He and They were addreſſed were committed, as the Counteſs of <hi>Erroll,</hi> &amp;c. And it was upon Advice of this Treachery from <hi>Scotland,</hi> that <hi>Bell</hi> was committed: and K. <hi>J.</hi> after his <hi>Tyrannical</hi> manner, would not ſuffer him to be Proſecuted, but forgave him this

            </p>
            <p>Our Author having ſo faithfully related this Paſſage, you muſt likewiſe take his word for what he tells <hi>c.</hi> 3. ſ. 1. <hi>n.</hi> 6. That <hi>Sir</hi> Charles Murray <hi>was clapt up a Priſoner by K.</hi> J. <hi>in the Fort of</hi> Kinſale, <hi>becauſe he profeſſed himſelf a Proteſtant</hi> (which he always was, and K. <hi>J.</hi> knew it) <hi>where he lay without being able to learn any Reaſon for his Confinement, from the</hi> 12th <hi>of</hi> March 1688. <hi>till toward the end of the following Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>—<hi>though be cou'd never learn either his Crime or his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer.</hi> Thus our Author.</p>
            <p>But not only Sir <hi>Charles</hi> (who is ſtill in K. <hi>J</hi>'s Service) but almoſt every body there, knew the reaſon of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, for it was publick, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sir <hi>Charles</hi> being aboard the <hi>French</hi> Admiral coming into <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſpoke ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſreſpectful and reflecting things of the <hi>French King;</hi> of which the <hi>French</hi> Admiral acquainted the Count <hi>d'Avaux</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, who made a complaint of it in his Maſters Name to K. <hi>J.</hi> who could do no leſs than commit Sir <hi>Charles</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>But neither of theſe Stories is ſo incredible as that Plot, <hi>p.</hi> 139. <hi>to Starve one half of the Proteſtants, and Hang the other.</hi> Which this Author takes a great deal of pains to prove was the Deſign; and that it was really attempted, by the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſell Bread to the Proteſtants, and taking what they had from them: Whereas Dr. <hi>Gorge</hi> tells (in his Letter) of the great Care and Kindneſs which K. <hi>J.</hi> ſhewed to the Proteſtants, particularly in <hi>Dublin,</hi> (which the Author makes the Scene of this <hi>Starving Tragedy</hi>) where, as the Doctor's Family told him, among other Inſtances of Juſtice done the Proteſtants while they were in <hi>Dublin,</hi> that two <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers were Hanged before a <hi>Proteſtant Bakers</hi> door for ſtealing two Loaves not worth a ſhilling: They hung 48 hours, of which ſeveral Proteſtants now in <hi>London</hi> were Eye-witneſſes. This did not look like a Deſign to <hi>ſtarve</hi> the Proteſtants, to let them have <hi>Bakers</hi> of their own, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them ſo. As unlikely is it, that they deſigned to <hi>Hang</hi> the other Half of the Proteſtants, when in all that time theſe Proteſtants were in their Power, <hi>viz.</hi> in Summer 89. they did not Hang one of them, though ſome of them
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59238:81"/>deſerved it by the Law then, as <hi>this Author</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bell</hi>— can witneſs.</p>
            <p>But what need both <hi>Hanging</hi> and <hi>Starving?</hi> Why, there were ſome of theſe Proteſtants would not ſtarve. The Author tells, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>n.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 174. That the Iriſh Generals kept ſome of them whom they drove before <hi>Derry,</hi> without Meat or Drink <hi>for a whole Week.</hi> And <hi>Hang</hi> that Proteſtant won't ſtrave in a Week.— But it ſeems King <hi>James</hi> had no mind to try the Experiment, for he ſent immediate Orders to diſcharge thoſe Proteſtants; and themſelves confeſs that Lieutenant General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (who was much againſt that Driving, but <hi>Roſen</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) ordered Meal and other Proviſions to be diſtributed amongſt them. I know not the Extent of <hi>Irish</hi> Abſtinence, but with us in <hi>England</hi> a Weeks Faſting will not eaſily be belived.</p>
            <p>It is as incredible that (as our Author ſays, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 79.) <hi>There was not one Corporation</hi> (in <hi>Ireland</hi>) <hi>found to have forfeited by a Legal Tryal:</hi> That <hi>all the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in the Kingdom were diſſolved without the leaſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or pretence of Abuſe of Privilege, or Forfeiture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Will any one believe, That Lawyers (and ſome of them this Author acknowledges to underſtand their Profeſſion) would bring a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt a Charter, and not ſo much as pretend any <hi>Abuſe</hi> of Privilege, or Forfeiture? I beſeech you, what was it they did pretend? Was it that they had <hi>not forfeited?</hi> Was that the Reaſon they gave for bringing a <hi>Quo Warranto?</hi> But the Author ſays, they did not ſo much as <hi>pretend</hi> any Reaſon. He may ſay what he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>I do not queſtion, but there might be many Abuſes in the manner of bringing thoſe <hi>Quo Warranto</hi>'s, and of managing them. But that there ſhould not be ſo much as a <hi>pretence</hi> of Forfeiture againſt any <hi>one,</hi> and yet <hi>all</hi> be forfeited in a Form of Law, and pleading in a Court, muſt paſs at beſt, for that way of repreſenting things in this Book to exceſs, at random, no matter ſo it be ill enough.</p>
            <p>I have heard good Lawyers ſay, That few Charters of Corporations could ſtand againſt a <hi>Quo VVarranto,</hi> if they were throughly examined: So far is it from a poſſibility of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59238:81"/>believing that all the Charters of <hi>Ireland</hi> could defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from any breach or abuſe of Privilege.</p>

            <p>But leaving theſe Matters of Form, you ſhall ſee this Author's Paſſion tranſporting him to that degree that he forgets himſelf, even to a Contradiction: When he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> he makes them <hi>force</hi> K. <hi>J.</hi> to all the ill he did; and then K. <hi>J.</hi> is a good natur'd and a merciful Man, and ſeeks to ſave the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the Cruelty of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> But when a Section comes, wherein K. <hi>J.</hi> is to be loaded, then he is fifteen times worſe than the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> then the <hi>Iriſh</hi> oppoſe <hi>his</hi> wicked Deſigns, and <hi>he</hi> cannot bring them to <hi>his</hi> pitch of Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>You would think this impoſſible to befal any Author of common Conſideration, but you ſhall be judge, <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 225. <q>He owns K. <hi>J</hi>'s <hi>natural Compaſſion and merciful Diſpoſition,</hi> c. 3. ſ. 1. p. 49. n. 8.

               </q> How falſe this is, I have ſhewn from the Teſtimony of my Lord <hi>Granard</hi> and others: But this is not the matter now; I am not now upon diſproving what he ſays, only to ſhew the Contradiction of what he avers.

               </q> Yet in the ſame page he makes K. <hi>J.</hi> a Monſter of Cruelty: He ſays, the very <hi>Iriſh</hi> Judges, <hi>Nugent</hi> himſelf, whom this Author makes the worſt of them all, were for acquitting Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> for making his eſcape from thoſe who came to plunder him: <q>
                  <hi>But after he</hi> (Judge <hi>Nugent</hi>) <hi>had diſcourſed His Majeſty, he proceeded vigorouſly againſt the Gentleman, and procured him to be

Their Deſign took effect at <hi>Bandon,</hi> which joyned with them: But the Lord Deputy having notice of their Proceedings, ſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Mac-Carty</hi> (now Lord <hi>Mount-Caſſell</hi>) to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; He pretending to keep fair with them, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted bringing him over to declare for the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſome of them had hopes of it: but he proved too cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for them, prevented their ſeizing of <hi>Corke,</hi> and when Captain <hi>Henry Boyle,</hi> upon that diſappointment, fortified his Houſe, <hi>Caſtle-Martyr,</hi> he beſieged him there. Upon this Sir <hi>Tho. Southwell</hi> in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and ſeveral other Proteſtant Gentlemen, marched with the greateſt Force they could make to raiſe the Siege; in their march they ſeiz'd on all the <hi>Papiſts Horſes;</hi> and this Mr. <hi>Browne,</hi> who
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59238:83"/>was then one of them, took the Horſes of <hi>Neagle</hi> of <hi>Moyallow,</hi> who was then High-Seriff of the County of <hi>Corke,</hi> and a Man was killed in the Fray; and all this our Author calls <hi>only making his eſcape from thoſe who came to plunder him.</hi> But to tell out my Story: Sir <hi>T. Southwell</hi> and his Company hearing upon their March, that <hi>Caſtle Martyr</hi> was ſurrendred, he endeavoured to make his way to <hi>Sligo,</hi> to joyn the Lord <hi>Kingſton</hi> and other <hi>Aſſociators</hi> in <hi>Connaught,</hi> who were all in Arms, and as this Author tells, <hi>p.</hi> 170. he and 200 of his Men were taken by a <hi>ſmall</hi> Party of K.

That they were over-perſuaded to plead Guilty, <hi>though they had not been guilty of any Overt Act that could be conſtrued Treaſon.</hi> What this Author means by <hi>Overt Acts,</hi> or what by <hi>Treaſon,</hi> he will tell us in the next, and likewiſe give us ſome probable Reaſon why K. <hi>J.</hi> ſhould <hi>Reprieve</hi> and afterwards <hi>Pardon</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> and all the reſt who were engaged in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and have ſuch a particular Malice only at <hi>Browne,</hi> whom he knew as little as any of the reſt. Otherwiſe he muſt give us leave to ſuſpend a little our belief of his Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative in this matter; particularly that K. <hi>J.</hi> ſhould influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence either Judge or Jury to take away Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Life, and that he ſhould be inexorable in Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Caſe alone, and yet ſo very merciful to all the reſt, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to believe, if his Caſe or Circumſtances did in no ways differ from theirs.</p>
            <p>But it is no wonder that this Author cannot keep him ſelf from Contradictions through the whole Series of his Book, when the very Titles, the Heads of his Diſcourſe, are contradictory one to another; which one would think an ordinary Care might have avoided. C. 2. <hi>ſ.</hi> 8. <hi>n</hi> 10. the Title is, <hi>That K.</hi> J's <hi>Deſire to be abſolute induced him to change his Religion:</hi> And yet, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 5. the Title is, <hi>Zeal for his Religion made him act againſt his Interest, to that Degree,</hi> (ſays this Author, in his Proſecution of this, <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>ſ.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 46.) <hi>that the Proteſtants could not but conclude that K. J. was ſo intent upon deſtroying them, that, ſo he compaſſed that Deſign, he cared not if he enſlaved himſelf and the Kingdoms.</hi> P. 45. <hi>That he had a ſetled Reſolution not to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59238:83"/>mind any Intereſt which came in Competition with his grand Deſign of advancing</hi> Popery <hi>and the Slavery of the Nations. To effect which, it is manifeſt he was content to be a Vaſſal to</hi> France. Thus the Author. Here are Contradictions upon Contradictions; That K. <hi>J.</hi> ſhould be content to be a <hi>Vaſſal,</hi> that he might be <hi>Abſolute!</hi> If you ſay, that muſt be underſtood only of his other Grand Deſign, <hi>viz. advancing Popery,</hi> which had the Aſcendant even over his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> or his deſire of being <hi>Abſolute.</hi> This will contradict the other Head of Diſcourſe, which gives the <hi>deſire of Abſoluteneſs</hi> in him the Aſcendant over his <hi>Religion,</hi> as being the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work and Motive which induc'd him to change his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet, page 10. of his Thankſgiving-Sermon, <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi> ſays he, <hi>K.</hi> J. <hi>chiefly deſired an Abſolute Authority over his Subjects, that he might compel them into the boſom of his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it does not appear a leſs Contradiction than any of theſe, that a King ſhould change the Principles of the <hi>Church of England [as then taught]</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> out of a deſire to be the more <hi>Abſolute.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (4 <hi>Coun. Lat C.</hi> 3, &amp;c.) gives Power to the Popes to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings, and they have ſhewn many Examples of it. On the other hand, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when K. <hi>J.</hi> forſook her Communion, damn'd this <hi>Depoſing Doctrine,</hi> and the Practice of it, and valued themſelves upon the Principle of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> to their King, <hi>upon any Pretence whatſoever,</hi> as their diſtinguiſhing Character, and an eſſential part of their Religion; and they had never varied from it, nor was it thought by any, or themſelves, that ever they would.</p>
            <p>I am ſure if they were not in earneſt with it <hi>then,</hi> they can give no demonſtration <hi>now</hi> that they can be in earn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for a King of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to quit <hi>this Church,</hi> and go to that Church which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the <hi>Depoſing Doctrine</hi>—to do this out of a deſire of <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That he took care to put it out of his own Power to help the Proteſtants. <hi>Qui occidere quemquam nolit, poſſe velit.</hi> It is not natural for an Arbitrary Man to deſire any thing to be out of his Power, much leſs would he <hi>take care</hi> to put it out of his own Power. If he did, it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of an inveterate malice to the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> yet they all think His being there was their Preſervation; that he hindered the <hi>Iriſh</hi> not only from Maſſacres, but from Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Plundering <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the whole Country when they left it, and many other Outrages: And our Author, when he is upon painting out the Barbarity of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> does fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently confeſs it, and inſiſt upon it; and as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny it, when his Spleen riſes againſt K. <hi>J.</hi>

            <p>In this I appeal to Secretary <hi>Gorge</hi>'s Letter; in which he gives a remarkable Inſtance of K. <hi>J</hi>'s both granting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and making it good to them, notwithſtanding the greateſt provocations; <hi>viz.</hi> Secretary <hi>Gorge</hi>'s Wife and Family were not only Protected and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by K. <hi>J.</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> while he was in ſo conſiderable a Poſt againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> as to be Secretary to the General

               <hi>Schomberg,</hi> then at the Head of an Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> to drive K. <hi>J.</hi> out thence; but upon their application to K. <hi>J.</hi> he gave them leave and his Paſs port to go to the Secretary to <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Army. And thus by K. <hi>J</hi>'s Clemency he had his Wife and Family reſtored ſafe to him, at the ſame time that he was endeavouring to diſpoſſeſs K. <hi>J.</hi> of all he had in the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Secretary,</hi> in his Letter, aggravates the Breach of Protections, and want of Diſcipline in <hi>Schomberg</hi>'s Army, by ſhewing how regularly King <hi>James</hi> governed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and not only threatned ſevere Penalties upon the Breach of his Proclamations and Protections, but duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted them.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The reſpective Penalties injoyned in the ſaid Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (ſays the <hi>Secretary,</hi> viz.

            </p>
            <p>I demand further, Whether the ſaid Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi> did not, upon his application to King <hi>James,</hi> obtain leave for the Merchants of <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and of the Country about, to return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other places whither they had fled, even after the time limitted by His Majeſties Proclamation for their Return? And whether, upon a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond application to His Majeſty, and repreſenting that there was an Embargo on the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide, King <hi>James</hi> did not grant them time to return, without ſtinting them to any day, while any reaſonable Excuſe could be made for their delay?</p>
            <p>And whether he (the ſaid Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi>) did not ſend Notice of this to the <hi>Belfaſt</hi> Merchants, and others then in <hi>Scotland?</hi> And though few or none of them came over till after <hi>Schomberg</hi> landed in <hi>Ireland</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 89; yet whether their Goods were not preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for them all that time by King <hi>James</hi>'s Order, ſtill expecting their Return?

Nay, ever when <hi>Schomberg</hi> landed, and King <hi>James</hi> was obliged to remove from that Country, and leave it to the Enemy, Whether he did not give ſpecial Directions to Major-General <hi>Maxwell,</hi> then Commanding in <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> not to ſuffer any of the Goods of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to be plundered, nor any of the Country to be burnt upon their leaving it? And whether theſe Commands of His Majeſty were not punctually obſerved, not only at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> but at <hi>Lisburn, Hillsborough,</hi> and all that Country, and even at <hi>Dundalk</hi> it ſelf, which King <hi>James</hi> left in good Order for <hi>Schomberg</hi> to encamp in, and make his Frontier his firſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne?</p>
            <p>Neither will Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi> deny, That Mr. <hi>Thomas Crocker,</hi> Merchant of <hi>Yoghall</hi> in the Province of <hi>Munſter</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſeveral other Merchants of <hi>Yoghall, Cork,</hi> and other places of that Province, did complain to him, That their Friends which ſtay'd behind in <hi>Ireland</hi> while King <hi>James</hi> was there, did make no application in their behalf to King <hi>James</hi> (whether out of negligence or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs); which if it had been done, they did not doubt but they would have had their Goods preſerved for them, as they had at <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and other places in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> indeed in all places which deſired it.</p>
            <p>And I likewiſe deſire Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi> to tell whether the ſeveral Protections he obtained for theſe parts of the Country about <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> were not given <hi>gratis,</hi> without any Fees? And whether there was any Conditions, ſo much as an Oath, required of thoſe who returned, and took the benefit of His Majeſties Grace? And though their taking the Oath of Fidelity to King <hi>James</hi> was named in one of the Protections granted to <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and the Country about, (here inſerted, <hi>n.</hi> 23. <hi>Appendix.</hi>) yet, whether, upon Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi>'s repreſenting to my Lord <hi>Melfort,</hi> That the Oath might perhaps ſtartle ſome, and hinder their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, his Lordſhip did not allow Mr. <hi>Pottinger,</hi> and the other Magiſtrates, not to require the ſaid Oaths? And whether accordingly the Retinning Proteſtants and others
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59238:87"/>were not received into Protection, without any Oath at all required from them?</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> had tried the Security of Oaths before: They are certain Snares, and a very uncertain Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi> can likewiſe give Atteſtation to the Truth of what Secretary <hi>Gorge</hi> has told in his Letter, of King <hi>James</hi>'s not only keeping his Protections to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but of the extraordinary kindneſs he upon all Occaſions expreſſed to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> How ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships which came into <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> (ſome from the <hi>Indies,</hi> who knew not of the War, others by ſtreſs of Weather, or other Cauſes) and were ſeized by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> were always Relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by King <hi>James,</hi> were ſuffered to unload, and to load again, and purſue their Voyage to <hi>England.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pottinger</hi> can tell the Ships, their Burthen, aad their Maſters Names. Nay, King <hi>James</hi> did not only releaſe particular Ships upon their application, but gave general Orders to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General <hi>Maxwell,</hi> and others Commanding on the Sea-Coaſts in the <hi>North,</hi> (and we ſuppoſe the like in other places) That no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship ſhould be diſturb'd which came thither.</p>
            <p>Many more Inſtances might be given; but theſe are ſufficient to demonſtrate that King <hi>James</hi> did not only freely grant and inviolably keep his Protections to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but extended it likewiſe to as many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as came under his Power, though againſt their Will.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Fleet which carried King <hi>James</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi> took ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant-men while His Majeſty was on board; and ſome of the Maſters were brought before King <hi>James;</hi> who, expecting nothing but Death, fell down upon their knees begging their Lives; which brought Tears into the King's Eyes, and he not only reſtored them their Ships with all their Effects, but ordered two Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats to attend them, and ſee them ſafe through all the <hi>French</hi> Fleet.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59238:89"/>And yet I have heard many <hi>Iriſh</hi> Proteſtants, who live in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> and near it, ſay, That they have not heard of any Rapes upon the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Women there, as this Author ſpeaks, even by the <hi>Rapparees;</hi> for that Country being thick planted with <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Rapparees</hi> durſt not be too bold. Which you will eaſily believe, when you find what Oppoſition they were able to give, even to the King's Army.</p>
            <p>But to go on with the Story:</p>
            <p>There was one <hi>Henry Hunter,</hi> a Servant to Sir <hi>George Atchiſon</hi> in the County of <hi>Ardmagh,</hi> in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who was made a Captain by the <hi>Aſſociators.</hi> Their Forces being beaten and diſperſed at <hi>Drommore</hi> the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> 1688. this <hi>Hunter</hi> was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner near <hi>Antrim;</hi> from whence he made his Eſcape about the middle of <hi>April</hi> following, and came into the Barony of <hi>Ardes</hi> in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> where they had all taken Protections from King <hi>James,</hi> and lived Peaceably; there being but one Company quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in that whole Barony, (which is almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Scots Proteſtants</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> Captain <hi>Con Mac-Gennis</hi> his Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hunter</hi> coming thither, got a great Rabble of theſe poor People to follow him; and about the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. they had a Scuffle with this Company of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Mac-Gennis,</hi> and what other <hi>Iriſh</hi> came to their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance at <hi>Kinnin-Burne,</hi> two Miles from <hi>New-Town. Hunter</hi>'s Rabble routed them, ſtript and wounded many, I know not if any kill'd; but he drove them out of that Barony.</p>
            <p>This occaſioned Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Mark Talbot</hi> to march from <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> with about an hundred Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers, the 15th of <hi>April</hi> to <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and the 16th to <hi>Newtown;</hi> But finding the Matter over, and, ſome ſay, fearing the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were in great Numbers, and rolling about, he returned the 17th to <hi>Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59238:90"/>This Commotion gave great Diſturbance to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, People leaving their Ploughs, and flying to Arms, the Wiſer ſort dreading the Conſequence of this wild Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, after they had taken Protection from the King.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Maxwell</hi> then living in the Caſtle of <hi>Killi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagh</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Down,</hi> and near the Barony of <hi>Ardes,</hi> where this Inſurrection began, ſent one <hi>John Stuart,</hi> an Apothecary in the Town of <hi>Down,</hi> with a Letter to Captain <hi>Patrick Savage</hi> (a Captain in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of the Lord <hi>Iveagh</hi>) to invite him to bring his Company to quarter in the Town of <hi>Killileagh,</hi> for their Security from the Rabble in this Confuſion. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Captain <hi>Savage</hi> came, and finding theſe People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe after <hi>Hunter,</hi> and fearing he might be ſurprized, quartering with his Men in the open Town, he deſired Sir <hi>Robert</hi> to permit him to keep his Guard in the Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or Stables of the Caſtle. Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but took two days to conſider of it; and in theſe two days he ſent one <hi>Gawen Irwin</hi> twice to <hi>Hunter,</hi> to bring him thither; who accordingly came with his Rabble, ſeized Captain <hi>Savage</hi> and his Lieurenant in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, fell upon the Guard, killed <hi>three</hi> Men, and wounded <hi>ſix or ſeven.</hi> Captain <hi>Savage</hi> complained that Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had betray'd him; and Mr. <hi>Clulo,</hi> Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the place, did reſent the Barbarity of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and apprehending ſome further miſchief to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Savage,</hi> took him to his own Houſe, where, though a Priſoner, he had greater Accommodation and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Lord <hi>Iveagh</hi> wrote to Sir <hi>Robert Maxwell</hi> to ſend him his Captain and Lieutenant whom he kept Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. This Letter <hi>Hunter</hi> took upon him, and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> permitted him to anſwer; and the Anſwer was, That he would fight his Lordſhip; and accordingly marched out againſt my Lord, with what part of his Lordſhip's Regiment he had near <hi>Killileagh,</hi> and other Countrey-people of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who joined him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59238:90"/>The Lord <hi>Iveagh</hi> retired; but endeavoured to make a Stand at <hi>Ceyle-bridge,</hi> near the Town of <hi>Down. Hunter</hi> forced his Paſſage, and drove my Lord and his Men over the Strand of <hi>Dun-Drum,</hi> into the upper and Mountainous parts of the County, for which his Lordſhip's Regiment was broke by King <hi>James. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> entred <hi>Down</hi> Triumphant, and uſed thoſe <hi>Prete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> who would not joyn with him, as ill as the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> committed great Diſorders and Irregularities in that Countrey, and Governed Arbitrarily during his ſhort Reign.</p>
            <p>For now the Inſurrection was come to that Head, that it was fit for the Government to take notice of it. Major-General <hi>Buchan</hi> (whom this Author calls <hi>Bohan</hi>) was commanded againſt <hi>Hunter;</hi> he took with him De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachements out of the Duke of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Regiment of Foot, the Earl of <hi>Antrim</hi>'s Regiment of Foot, Colonel <hi>Cormock O Neil</hi>'s Regiment of Foot, and a Troop of Horſe of the Lord <hi>Galm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi>'s Regiment, and Colonel <hi>Cormock O Neil</hi>'s Troop of Dragoons, which he had with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Foot, and Captain <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi>'s Troop of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons. Theſe Forces were then at <hi>Carrickfergus, Antrim,</hi> and <hi>Lisburn.</hi> The Major-General marched with the Horſe and Dragoons, and left the Foot to follow with what Diſpatch they could, who marched in one day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 30th of <hi>April</hi> 1689. from <hi>Lisburn</hi> to <hi>Killileagh,</hi> which is ſixteen long <hi>Iriſh</hi> Miles; they joyned the General about Five at Night, who being then within two Miles of the Enemy, marched directly upon them.</p>
            <p>Being come within ſight of them, he ſent a Trumpet to them, deſiring their Leader, or ſome of the Chief of them, to ſpeak with him; not doubting but upon the gracious Offers he was impowered by His Majeſty to make to them, he would have been able to bring back theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded People to their Duty, without ſhedding of Blood on either ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59238:91"/>But they fired upon the Trumpeter, and refuſed all Parley; ſo they engaged. <hi>Hunter</hi> was beaten, and fled, and his Party diſperſed.</p>
            <p>I cannot learn the exact Number of <hi>Hunter</hi>'s Army, or of the Slain. Some ſay he had three or four Thouſand Men. Others not above four Hundred, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, ſome computing the whole Rabble which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; others only thoſe that charged in form a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Buchan,</hi> but not thoſe upon the Hills, and at grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſtance.</p>
            <p>Some who pretend to have viewed the Field, and helped to bury the Dead, ſay there were but <hi>ſixty One</hi> of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Men killed; and others ſay a great many more.</p>
            <p>However, that makes nothing to our preſent Diſpute. How many were killed in Battle is not the Queſtion. But our Author ſays, That Major-General <hi>Buchan</hi> Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>five or ſix Hundred,</hi> in cold Blood, for ſeveral Days together.</p>
            <p>The contrary of which appears, from theſe two Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, known to all the Country.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, That the Major-General was very Merciful, even on the Day of Battle.</item>
               <item>Secondly, That he marched off his Men early next Morning, and ſo did not ſtay to Maſſacre, <hi>for ſeveral Days together.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the Firſt. He ſtopped Execution as ſoon as the Enemy were broke, and out of Danger of Rallying: And tho' ſeveral Shot were made againſt him out of the Caſtle of <hi>Killileagh,</hi> as he was in purſuit of the Enemy, part of Colonel <hi>Mark Talbot</hi>'s Wigg was ſhot off by a Bullet from the Caſtle. Yet when he reduced that Caſtle (which he did the ſame Night) he not only gave Quarters for their Lives, but would not ſuffer his Men to take any Plunder. There Major <hi>Colaghan</hi> ſhot one of his Men for putting his Hand to a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> after Order given that they ſhould neither be Killed, nor Plundered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59238:91"/>Nay farther, The Major-General was ſo careful, leſt the Souldiers, ſo exaſperated, ſhould do prejudice to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Town, that, though the Foot had Marched ſixteen Miles that Day, and fought in the Evening, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any time to refreſh themſelves, and many of them actually Fainting with the Toyl; yet he would not ſuffer them to come into the Town, but drew them up upon an adjacent Hill, where he kept them all Night; and early next Morning Marched them back to <hi>New Town</hi> (a Town belonging to Sir <hi>Robert Colvil</hi>) into which he would not ſuffer them to enter, for the ſame fear of their doing any prejudice to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (who wholly inhabit that Town.) He only took a Guard of Horſe, and ſome Officers with himſelf into the Town to refreſh themſelves, where not one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> was hurt or toucht: There he diſmiſt all the Priſoners he had taken at the Fight of <hi>Killileagh,</hi> requiring no other Conditions of them, but an OATH not to bear ARMS again in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to King <hi>James</hi> (which we know how well they kept, the firſt Opportunity they had to break it.) And tho' theſe Priſoners, as well as thoſe that were killed, had then King <hi>James</hi>'s Protections in their Pocket (of which King <hi>James</hi> did very juſtly Complain, though this Author Wonders at it;) yet the General did not require them to take out New Protections, but ſaid the Old ſhould be as Effectual to them as before their Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and they were made good to them to the Day that <hi>Schomberg</hi> Landed.</p>
            <p>The General here ſent home the Foot to their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and went himſelf with ſome Horſe to <hi>Port a Ferry</hi> in the <hi>Ardes,</hi> where he took one <hi>Thomas Hunter</hi> Priſoner. And having ſettled that Part of the Country returned.</p>
            <p>As the Iriſh Forces Marched over <hi>Belfaſt</hi> Bridge, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Quarters, their Officers ſtopped them, and ſearched to ſee if any of them had taken any Plunder in that Expedition: And what they found cauſed it to be delivered to Mr. <hi>Pottinger,</hi> then Sovereign of the Town, to be put up in the Town-Houſe, in order to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59238:92"/>to the Owners, as they ſhould be known, which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>And the Officers would not permit the Souldiers to make the leaſt halt in the Town, for fear of Diſorders, but Marched them ſtraight thro' to their Quarters at <hi>Carrick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fergus.</hi> In which they were ſo ſtrict, that Major <hi>Colaghan</hi> broake a Souldiers Head for taking a Glaſs of Ale at a Door as he Marched by. Only the Regiment Quartered at <hi>Antrim,</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Belfaſt</hi> that Night, not being able to march ſo fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, but committed not the leaſt Diſorder.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Officers of King <hi>William</hi>'s Army been as careful of their <hi>Fellow Proteſtants</hi> in that Country, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had not been that Wilderneſs and Deſolation, which we ſee it this Day.</p>
            <p>It is juſt and commendable to give our Enemies their due, and not to conceal or leſſen what they do worthily, becauſe they are our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Iriſh Officers</hi> were kind to the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> not only in making good their Protections to them, but even where they had not Protections, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at their Mercy.</p>
            <p>I could give many Inſtances which I have heard from the Mouths of Proteſtant Gentlemen and Ladies, who remained in <hi>Ireland</hi> while King <hi>James</hi> was there, of the great Civility of ſeveral of the <hi>Iriſh Officers</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>When the general Rout was given to the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at <hi>Drommore,</hi> upon the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of King <hi>James</hi>'s Army, on the 14th of <hi>March,</hi> 1688. and all were flying to the Sea as faſt as they could, ſeveral <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſell into the Enemies hand at <hi>Donaghadee,</hi> a Sea-Port in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> where they ſought Opportunity of Shipping, to have fled out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Among theſe was Mrs. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> Wife to <hi>John Haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Raffer-Iſland</hi> in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> one of the moſt zealous and active of any in the <hi>North</hi> for the <hi>Aſſociation;</hi> in which Cauſe he was a Colonel, and had his Commiſſion from the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> (as all the reſt had) before he was made a <hi>King.</hi> He was among the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59238:92"/>firſt <hi>Aſſociators,</hi> and made himſelf Secretary to the <hi>Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> carried on at <hi>Moyrah</hi> by the Lord <hi>Blayney,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Rawden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>All the Declarations of this <hi>Aſſociation</hi> were Signed <hi>Per Order. John Hawkins.</hi> This was before the Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Council of Five,</hi> or more General <hi>Aſſociation</hi> in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. who ſent an Addreſs to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> dated at <hi>Hilsborough</hi> the 19th of <hi>January,</hi> 1688. which his Highneſs anſwered by his Letter from <hi>St. James's,</hi> dated the <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary,</hi> 1688. and ſent by Captain <hi>Leighton,</hi> with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to them for <hi>Colonels, Captains,</hi> and <hi>Subalterns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is a Digreſſion: It is only to ſhew you that no man was more obnoxious to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to the Government, than this Mr. <hi>Hawkins;</hi> in ſo much that he was one of the <hi>Ten</hi> excepted from Pardon in the Proclamation before-mentioned, of the Seventh of <hi>March,</hi> 1688.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman's Lady, being taken, among many others, making her Eſcape, at <hi>Donoghadee,</hi> inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Plundered, was civilly treated, and ſuffered to go off to Sea, not only her ſelf, but with all her Goods, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when ſhe offered her Coach as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Major <hi>Colaghon,</hi> he refuſed it, and did not take the Worth of a Penny from her.</p>
            <p>I could give you many more Inſtances which I have heard. But we muſt not make too great Digreſſions: I am afraid of being tedious.</p>
            <p>Let us Return to our Author's bloody Maſſacre of the Proteſtants in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> by Major-General <hi>Buchan,</hi> which was the Subject from whence we have been carried thus far.</p>
            <p>It was one of this Author's unfortunate days, that he light upon Major-General <hi>Buchan</hi> to make the <hi>Maſacrer</hi> in cold Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all that know that Gentleman, know him to be a Soldier, and incapable of any ſuch Brutality. It is ſo far from it, that the common Voice of all the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> does proclaim how much they owe to Lieutenant-General <hi>Hamilton,</hi> to this Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59238:93"/>
               <hi>Buchan,</hi> and to Major-General <hi>Maxwell,</hi> for their great Care, and even Generoſity to the Proteſtants in <hi>Ulſter;</hi> though what they did, (even that of Major-General <hi>Maxwel</hi>'s preſerving <hi>Belfaſt</hi> and all the Country, when <hi>Schomberg</hi> Landed) was, as themſelves own, by King <hi>James</hi>'s expreſs Order.</p>
            <p>But he muſt have no ſhare of the Thanks, even by thoſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who extol his Officers for nothing but duly executing his Orders.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> were as much offended on the other hand againſt theſe Three, <hi>Scots</hi> Generals, for their Partiality, as they called it, to their own Countrymen, tho' in Rebellion; becauſe they reſtrained the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> by King <hi>James</hi>'s parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Order, from uſing any Violence towards the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did loudly curſe <hi>Hunter</hi> for the Miſchief he had brought upon them; but laid no blame upon Major-General <hi>Buchan</hi> or his Army. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they do to this day acknowledge, That they were dealt with much more favourably than they could have expected, conſidering the Provocations they had given.</p>
            <p>It will be needleſs to make Application of all theſe Paſſages in the County of <hi>Down,</hi> to that Repreſentation which this Author gives of them.</p>
            <p>The thing ſhews it ſelf; and I have reſolved to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all angry Words: <hi>Reaſon,</hi> not <hi>Paſſion,</hi> gives a true <hi>Conviction,</hi> and the ſevereſt <hi>Reproof</hi> to all Falſhood and Inſincerity.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader judge from what has been ſaid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the County of <hi>Down</hi> proceeded no farther (as this Author confidently avers) than to complain to the Officers of King <hi>James</hi>'s Army, and to demand Redreſs of their Grievances from them?

            <p>I have ſpoke with ſome Gentlemen, who were then in that Fort, upon its Surrender, who ſay; that this is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely falſe; for that they were uſed with Humanity by K. <hi>J.</hi> and that he preſerv'd the Articles to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to give the Chief of them his Paſs to go for <hi>England,</hi> when it was deſired purſuant to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</p>
            <p>So wicked, as well as ignorant, is that Aſſertion of this Authors, <hi>p.</hi> 178. <hi>That amongſt all the Articles into which K.</hi> J. <hi>or his Officers entred, they never kept any to the Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How often have I heard the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> here ſpeak with Honour and Commendation of <hi>Sarsfield</hi>'s punctual obſervation of his Articles, when he took <hi>Sligo?</hi> and ſeveral other inſtances. And I have heard the moſt Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous among them for this Government complain much, that the Articles made with <hi>Carrickfergus</hi> by <hi>Schomberg,</hi> were not as punctually obſerv'd. But they laid the fault upon the Souldiers, who were their Conduct, who before they were a Mile from the Town, ſaw the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people plunder and ſtrip them; and ſome ſay, the Souldiers too put to their hand: But however there were none puniſhed for this. And the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain, That Major <hi>Mac-Swiney,</hi> and ſeveral other Officers of the Garriſon of <hi>Carrick-fergus</hi> were kept priſoners contrary to the Capitulations ſign'd by <hi>Mareſhal Schomberg</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>And that the ſick and wounded Officers and Souldiers in <hi>Drogheda,</hi> who, upon its Surrender after the <hi>Boyn,</hi> were, by the Capitulations, to be taken care of, and ſent with paſſes to their own Army, as they recovered their Health, were not only neglected, and might have ſtarved, but for the Charity of ſome poor people of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſold their Beds and Cloaths to Relieve them, but were kept as priſoners after they Recovered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Capitulations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59238:94"/>And that upon the Surrender of <hi>Cork,</hi> the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, tho' Priſoners of War, were, by the Conditions, to be well uſed, notwithſtanding of which, they ſay, that the General narrowly eſcaped being Murthered by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and had no Juſtice done him, nor any Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, upon his Complaint to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General. That ſeveral of the Earl of <hi>Clankerty</hi>'s Servants were forced from him, to ſerve Major General—</p>
            <p>And that the Garriſon, after laying down their Arms, were <hi>Stripped,</hi> and Marched to a Marſhy wet ground, where they were kept with Guards <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> days, and not being Suſtained, were forced through Hungar, to Eat dead Horſes that lay about them, and ſeveral of them Dyed for Want.. That when they were Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thence, they were ſo crowded in Jails, Houſes, and Churches, that they could not all lye down at once, and had nothing but the bare Floor to lye on, where, for want of Suſtenance, and lying in their own Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with dead Carcaſſes, lying whole Weeks in the ſame place with them, cauſed ſuch infection, that they Dyed in great Numbers Daily.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Roman Catholick Inhabitants,</hi> tho' pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Safty and Protection, had their Goods Seized, and themſelves Stripped, and turned out of Town ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>December</hi> 1690. one Captain <hi>Lawder,</hi> of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Hales</hi>'s Regiment, being ordered, with a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Enſigne, and <hi>Fifty</hi> men to Guard about <hi>Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> of the <hi>Cork</hi> Priſoners to <hi>Clonmell,</hi> as they fainted on the way, thro' the 'boveſaid bad Uſage, Shot them, to the number of <hi>Sixteen,</hi> between <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Clonmell:</hi> That Major General <hi>Dorington,</hi> did demand Juſtice againſt this Officer, from General <hi>Ginckle:</hi> But that <hi>Lawder</hi> has a Pardon for the Murder, and is ſtill continued in his Poſt.</p>
            <p>That after being entire Maſters of <hi>Athlone,</hi> they Killed, in cold Blood, an <hi>Hundred</hi> men in the Caſtle, and little Out-Work on the River.</p>
            <p>And at <hi>Aghram,</hi> above <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> who threw down their Arms, and asked Quarter, after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59238:94"/>abſolutely Maſters of the Field: and that ſeveral, who had Quarters given them, were after Killed in cold Blood, in which Number were the Lord <hi>Galway,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Charles Moore.</hi> And this is no Secret, the Major of Monſieur <hi>Epingham</hi>'s Dragoons owned to Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Dorington,</hi> That the Lord <hi>Galway</hi> was Killed after Quarter, and the Battle over. More Vouchers might be produced, if needful.</p>
            <p>They ſay further, that thoſe who ſurviv'd, found no Treatment like Priſoners of War, tho' General <hi>Ginckle</hi> engaged his Word and Honour for it, to Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Dorington,</hi> in the Preſonce of the Prince de <hi>Werten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> Mounſieur Marqueſs <hi>de la Foreſt,</hi> and other general Officers: And own'd the good Uſage their Priſoners had at <hi>Limerick,</hi> and other of King <hi>James</hi>'s Gariſons, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that his Priſoners ſhould be as well Treated by K. <hi>W.</hi> And theſe promiſes he reiterated <hi>three</hi> days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one another, to Major General <hi>Dorington,</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Aghram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Breach of this publick Faith to the ordinary and meaner ſort, theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſay is Notorious to all that live in that Country, and will not be Denied by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves: But what is more extrarodina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, That theſe general Officers, and others, who are now in the <hi>Tower,</hi> are Metamorphos'd from Priſoners of <hi>War,</hi> to Priſoners of <hi>State,</hi> and Committed for <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> which they ſay, General <hi>Ginckle</hi> himſelf did acknowledge to the ſaid Priſoners at the <hi>Tower,</hi> to be contrary to his Promiſe, and that he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do them all the Service he could, but not with the Succeſs he deſired. By which theſe Gentlemen ſay, they have Diſcovered what will be very New, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing to old Soldiers, and Men of Honour, <hi>viz.</hi> That Princes are not obliged to make good their Generals Promiſes, tho' ſuch Promiſes do not Exceed the Cuſtoms of War, and (hitherto) Law of Nations.</p>
            <p>Add to this the ſending many <hi>Hundreds</hi> of theſe poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> Priſoners at a time into <hi>Lambay</hi> (a waſte Deſart Iſland in the Sea near <hi>Dublin</hi>) where their Allowance, they ſay, for <hi>four</hi> Days, might, without Exceſs, be Eat
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59238:95"/>at a Meal, and being thus out of the reach of their Friends, who could not come at them, to give them any Charity, they Dyed there miſerably in heaps. They Complain too, that a great many poor Men were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from their Families, to ſwell up the Number of Priſoners, who were reported to be Sold to the <hi>Jew,</hi> who Furniſhed K. <hi>W.</hi>'s Army with Bread: But the vaſt Number of poor harmleſs <hi>Natives,</hi> who were daily Kill'd up and down the Fields, as they were following their Labour, or taken out of their Beds and Hanged, or Shot immediately for <hi>Rapparees;</hi> is a moſt Terrible Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del to the <hi>Government,</hi> which the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> themſelves do Loudly Atteſt; and many of the Country Gentlemen, as likewiſe ſeveral Officers, even of K. <hi>W.</hi>'s Army, who had more Bowels or Juſtice than the reſt, did Abhor to ſee what ſmall Evidence, or even Preſumption was thought ſufficient to Condemn men for <hi>Rapparees,</hi> and what ſport they made to Hang up poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> Pnople by Dozens, almoſt without pains to Examine them; they hardly thought them <hi>Humane Kind!</hi> And ſince the Peace, have firſt Robbed them, tho' under the Capitulations of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and then ſuffered them to Starve in Ditches, and Eat dead Horſes in the High-way, which I have been told by many <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Gentlemen, who have ſeen it, and extreamly Lamented it, to ſee Men Diveſted of common Mercy or Compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> do Complain of Breach of publick Faith to thoſe who Submitted to the Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on K. <hi>W.</hi>'s repeated Declarations, notwithſtanding of which, they are Out-law'd, and Proſecuted, (ſee the Reſolution of the Judges at <hi>Dublin,</hi> Numb. 7. <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And that by Diſarming of Gentlemen, contrary to the Articles of <hi>Limerick,</hi> taking away their Fowling Guns, as well as Riding Arms, both Swords and piſtols, with ſuch Difficulties, and Conditions required to make their Right of being Included in the Capitulations appear, and their open grudging and repining, to make good one Article, ſaying openly, That they will have them Revers'd in <hi>Parliament:</hi> Beſides, the Country <hi>Militia</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59238:95"/>falling upon, and Robbing the poor <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who came out of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and the reſt of K. <hi>James</hi>'s Quarters, and by many other Indications they have made it known, what Security is to be expected from their Protections; and whether K. <hi>James</hi>'s or K. <hi>William</hi>'s Protections were beſt obſerv'd. The Truth is, there are none of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> that belong to the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I have met with, but do confeſs, That the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> while among them in Summer 89. kept their Protections bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> than the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have kept theirs to them ſince.</p>
            <p>Nay, one, who was of conſiderable Poſt there at that time, told me in theſe words: <hi>The Truth is,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it was in the Power of their Gentlemen and Officers to make their Protections be obſerved; but that is not in our Power: For our Country Folks will not be reſtrained from falling upon the</hi> Iriſh. Doctor <hi>Gorges</hi> Letter in the <hi>Appendix</hi> vouches this.</p>
            <p>But to come to an end of this Head, of this Authors manner of Repreſenting K. <hi>J.</hi> he ſayes, cap. 3. §. 18. n. 11. p. 213. <hi>That K.</hi> J. <hi>appeared moſt zealous to have the Church of</hi> Wexford, <hi>(which had been ſeized by the Popiſh Clergy) Reſtored to the</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>and expreſſed himſelf with more paſſion than was uſual, that he would be obey'd, and turned out the Major of</hi> Wexford <hi>for not Reſtoring the Church when commanded:</hi> Notwithſtanding, our Author tells, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> would not obey him. Here the King has wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Miniſters,</hi> but <hi>Himſelf</hi> is Good and Kind to the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But cap. 3. §. 6. n. 1. p. 82. he is ſo mad againſt them, That for the Advancement of Popery, <hi>He deſign'd the Ruine of Trade in all his Kingdoms.</hi> But p. 83. n. 2. <hi>Whatever be ſaid of the general Deſign, it is certain</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>K.</hi> James <hi>Rained the Trade of</hi> Ireland <hi>in proſecution of his purpoſe of Deſtroying the Proteſtants there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now comes a Myſtery, for p. 87. n. 8. he ſayes, <hi>That K.</hi> James <hi>went a great way in deſtroying the Trade of the</hi> Roman-Catholicks <hi>alſo; and left the most conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Roman-Catholick <hi>Traders in</hi> Ireland, <hi>without Estates
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59238:96"/>or Credit to follow their Trade, or Anſwer their Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondents abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why? What is the matter now? Theſe were the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens chiefly of <hi>Gallway,</hi> who had purchaſed Eſtates under the <hi>Acts of Settlement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems as if he had gone upon a principle of Juſtice, to Ruine their own moſt Conſiderable Traders, where-ever they thought their Title unjuſt.</p>
            <p>But if they made not Juſtice their Rule, which our Author ſuppoſes, then, Why might they not have Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted their own Merchants, and Purchaſers by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Proviſo</hi>'s, or given them Reprizals out of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Forfeited Eſtates?</p>
            <p>But I ſtay not with this. K <hi>James,</hi> ſayes our Author,<note place="margin">Of K. <hi>James</hi> letting the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> Decay.</note> p. 82. <hi>purpoſely let the Ships of</hi> England <hi>Decay and Rot, that the</hi> French <hi>might grow great at Sea, and Destroy the Trade of the</hi> Engliſh. Here is a piece of politicks of our Authors Refining: What was the Deſign of this? <hi>To humble his Subjects!</hi> ſayes the Author. This was a deep plot! But would not this <hi>Humble himſelf too?</hi> Yes, as I told you before, our Author ſayes, p. 45. <hi>It was manifest that he was content to be a Vaſſal to</hi> France.</p>
            <p>A delicate Receit to make himſelf Great and Arbitrary! <hi>If we conſider the Condition,</hi> ſayes the Au-p. 82. <hi>in which their preſent</hi> Majeſties <hi>found the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Fleet, the thing will not want probability.</hi> This was a perilous Argument. Suppoſe many Ships had been Loſt and Decayed, might it not be by misfortunes or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect? There came a Lift to the <hi>Parliament</hi> laſt year, of above <hi>Thirty</hi> Men of War, Loſt, and <hi>Eight</hi> diſabled, by ſeveral misfortunes, ſince the preſent Revolution, annexed, n. 12. <hi>Appendix;</hi> will any ſay this was done on purpoſe to let the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for example, grow great at Sea, <hi>And deſtroy the Trade of the</hi> Engliſh? What would ſuch a Malicious <hi>Obſervator</hi> deſerve? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>One Thouſand</hi> Merchant Men have been taken by the <hi>French,</hi> the Loſs ſeveral <hi>Millions,</hi> during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War: As appears in the Petition of ſome of the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> preſented to Queen <hi>Mary</hi>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:59238:96"/>her ſelf, and after to her in Council by ſome of the ſaid Merchants laſt <hi>October,</hi> 92. with ſeveral other Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and Impoſitions upon them by the <hi>Government,</hi> to the Ruine of their Trade, as Preſſing their Seamen out of their Ships, obliging them to give Bonds, to go to ſuch Ports, and no other, Embargo's, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the Fleet have come in this <hi>Winter</hi> 92. there were printed Liſts, which were ſent to the <hi>Admiralty-Office,</hi> and to the ſeveral Captains, with the Names of the Men who have Deſerted their <hi>Majesties</hi> Service (as the Liſts ſpeak) out of the ſeveral Men of War which came in. That printed Sheet which I ſaw, was fill'd with the Deſerters of <hi>two</hi> Ships only, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Royal William,</hi> and the St. <hi>Andrew.</hi> I took the pains to Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon over the Mens Names, and there were Deſerters from the <hi>Royal William, two hundred ninety one,</hi> and from the St. <hi>Andrew, three hundred forty nine</hi> men; both make <hi>ſix hundred</hi> and <hi>forty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now our Authors Logick would infer, <hi>First,</hi> What Numbers may we ſuppoſe have Deſerted, and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would Deſert, if they had opportunity, out of the whole Fleet? <hi>Secondly,</hi> That theſe men are not paid, are very ill uſed, or otherwiſe Diſaffected to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That K. <hi>W.</hi> did this on purpoſe, for the aboveſaid Reaſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Stop can there be to <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Invention?</hi> This Author has not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo plauſible Reaſons even as theſe for K. <hi>J.</hi>'s Deſign to Deſtroy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet; yet he Avers it poſitively, and Builds upon it.</p>
            <p>But after all, Does our Author know very well, how K. <hi>J.</hi> left the <hi>Fleet?</hi> or how he minded the Trade of the Nation? we live here where we have reaſon to know better than this Author in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And we know, that among all K. <hi>J.</hi>'s Faults, this was never reckoned one. No King of <hi>England</hi> ever minded the Affairs of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> and the Encouragement of <hi>Trade,</hi> ſo much as King <hi>James;</hi> witneſs the noble Store-Houſes he built at <hi>Chattam,</hi> and other <hi>Ports,</hi> ſuch as <hi>England</hi> never ſaw the like: Nor were the Magazines and Stores ever bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter provided, than when K. <hi>James</hi> left them, for which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59238:97"/>I refer you and this Author to the Worthy Mr. <hi>Pepy's,</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> his <hi>Momoires touching the Royal Navy,</hi> printed here in the Year 1690. Of which I have put a ſhort Abſtract in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> n. 11. for their benefit who have not his book: As likewiſe Sir <hi>Peter Petts</hi> Speech, and the <hi>Seamens Addreſs</hi> to King <hi>J.</hi> By all which it will appear how perfectly groundleſs this Accuſation of our Authors is againſt King <hi>James.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it was ſtuffed into ſome <hi>News Letters,</hi> about that time, <hi>(for a certain Reaſon)</hi> and our Author ſends it over to us, now as a great Diſcovery. He ſayes, ſome body told him ſo, but he tells not who they were: But he has eaſed his Spleen, and Diſcovered his poor Intelligence, That his Reader may duely Weigh and Conſider, upon what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and ſure Grounds he ſets down all his <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> and Conſequently what Regard is to be paid to them.</p>
            <p>This Author had ſhewn himſelf a better Politician, and Hiſtorian, if he had Turn'd this Charge againſt King <hi>James,</hi> as I have heard ſeveral, and in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, urge it as a thing of the moſt dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and was with ſome men not the leaſt Objection againſt King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was ſo good a Husband of his money, that he was able to ſpare ſuch vaſt ſumms to the <hi>Navy,</hi> and many other Works for the publick; yet not Impoſe or Demand any Supply from his Subjects, who grew Rich in Trade, beyond the Example of former Reigns: And they ſaw it viſibly proceed from his great Care and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to <hi>Maritine Affairs,</hi> beyond any of his <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</hi> This, ſay theſe <hi>Politicians,</hi> would have made him over popular; and put him out of the power of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> for he would have wanted no money; and by ſhewing his people, that his Greatneſs made them Live without Taxes (which their many years Experience had told them alwayes did attend the Return of <hi>Parliaments</hi>) It would have been a Dangerous Temptation to them to have wiſht him <hi>Abſolute,</hi> while it kept them Rich, and Free from Taxes. And, had not <hi>Popery</hi> been in the caſe, he might have bid fairer for <hi>Arbitrarineſs</hi> in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59238:97"/>than by that this Author has found out, of letting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet decay, on purpoſe that he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Vaſſal to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since I wrote this, I met, in the <hi>Third Edition</hi> of this Authors Book, c. 3. §. 6. n. 1. p. 93 a <hi>Nota Bene</hi> in the Margent, in theſe words, <hi>viz. N. B. The Author living in another Kingdom, and not knowing how much had been expended on the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Navy, towards the end of King</hi> James's <hi>Reign, was led into this Inference by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the then Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>found no Oppoſition at Sea, when he came for</hi> England. <hi>But the preceding Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of King</hi> James, <hi>and his Friends in</hi> Ireland <hi>are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly Related, and might purpoſely be Deſign'd, to encourage the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Nation into the Facility of Invading</hi> England, <hi>nothing being, at that time, more univerſally talk'd of, or reſolved by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>N. B.</hi> And let us Mark it well: It is a <hi>Recantation</hi> of what he had ſaid of K. <hi>James</hi>'s letting the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> Decay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this he would induce his Reader to Believe, That this was the only <hi>Erratum</hi> of his whole Book, and that he was ready to own it, as ſoon as Convinc'd: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſettles a good Opinion of his own Integrity, and Ingenuity: And at the ſame time, Confirms the Truth of all the other <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> in his Book; becauſe it is to be ſuppos'd, That if he could have found any other Miſtakes in his Book, he would have Rectified them, as well as this.</p>
            <p>Which if it be true, we muſt have more <hi>N. B.</hi>'s in his next <hi>Edition,</hi> after his ſeeing this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he muſt <hi>Confute</hi> the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> I have ſet down; upon which I do promiſe to <hi>Confeſs</hi> and <hi>Amend</hi> my <hi>Errors,</hi> as freely as I expect the like from him.</p>
            <p>He gives, for his Excuſe, his <hi>Living in another King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> This, Good Sir, will invalidat, not only Great Part, and the moſt <hi>Beauiſh</hi> of your Book, but of your Famous <hi>Thanksgiving Sermon,</hi> before-mentioned, where you play your <hi>Politicks</hi> upon the moſt private <hi>Intrigues</hi> of moſt of the <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> and tell
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59238:98"/>which <hi>Prince</hi> is to be <hi>Wheedled,</hi> which <hi>Frighted,</hi> which brought under <hi>Pupillage,</hi> what <hi>Queen</hi> to be made <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> what <hi>Country</hi> to be <hi>Bomb'd,</hi> what <hi>Bought,</hi> what <hi>Sold,</hi> and what <hi>Drown'd!</hi> And you were farther from all theſe than from <hi>England,</hi> and theſe Deſigns were harder to be known, than the publick Condition of our own <hi>Fleet,</hi> which any one may know that pleaſes, the <hi>Liſts</hi> of them being commonly Printed.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Since, as you now Confeſs, you did not know the State of the <hi>Navy,</hi> when K. <hi>James</hi> left it; How come you to be ſo poſitive in it in your Book? Muſt not we believe, by this inſtance, That you are capable of Aſſerting very poſitively, what you know very little of?</p>
            <p>But this being a Falſhood ſo notoriouſly known in <hi>England,</hi> you thought, by Confeſſing that, to Lull them Aſleep to inquire no farther into what was done in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your very Confeſſion argues your Guilt, and ſhews it came not from a clear Converſion of your <hi>Conſcience:</hi> For you do it by halves, and unwillingly.

The contrary to which, you will ſee in the ſhort Abſtract of Mr. <hi>Pepys</hi>'s Account of the <hi>Navy,</hi> n. 11. <hi>Appendix.</hi> And no doubt, your <hi>Informer</hi> could have told you this, as well as the reſt, if you had had a mind to be inform'd.</p>
            <p>But the Reaſon you give of your former Miſtake, is beyond all this. You ſay, <hi>You were led into this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Of K. <hi>James</hi>'s letting the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59238:98"/>on purpoſe to Rume the Trade of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> might grow Great at Sea) <hi>by hearing that the then Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>found no Oppoſition at Sea, when he came for</hi> England.</p>
            <p>Could there be no other, Reaſon why the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> found no Oppoſition at Sea, but K. <hi>James</hi>'s pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely letting the Ships of <hi>England</hi> Decay, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> miſſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet? which was the Caſe: He found no Oppoſition at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> neither. Our Author might hence as well infer, that K. <hi>James</hi> purpoſely let all the <hi>Pikes</hi> and <hi>Guns</hi> in <hi>England</hi> Rot and Ruſt, <hi>&amp;c!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are theſe Inferences fit for a Biſhop, upon his ſerious Repentance for his publick Breach of the <hi>Ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> and <hi>Slandering</hi> the Foot-ſteps of GOD's <hi>Ancinted!</hi> And yet, in the ſame Breath, continuing to do it ſtill again, in Malice, that grows <hi>Ridiculous</hi> with its Rage: For in the next words, after his Confeſſing his Miſtake, he would have you believe, that K. <hi>James</hi> did own this <hi>Lye</hi> againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the preceding Diſcourſes of K.</hi> James—(ſayes the Author) <hi>are exactly Related.</hi> What were theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes? You have it told in his Book, in the ſame place where his <hi>Recantation</hi> is, <hi>viz.</hi> c. 3. §. 6. n. 1. Where he tells <hi>How many</hi> Roman Catholicks, <hi>who pretended to know his.</hi> (<hi>K.</hi> James's) <hi>mind, confidently affirmed, That he purpoſely let the Ships of</hi> England <hi>Decay and R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, that the</hi> French <hi>might grow Great at Sea, and Deſtroy the Trade of the</hi> Engliſh — <hi>And</hi> (ſayes the Author) <hi>the King himſelf could not ſometimes forbear words to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this the Author, even in Penitentials, Affirms to be <hi>Exactly Related.</hi> And, no doubt, he muſt think his ſtock of Credit very great, that, upon his bare Word, we ſhould believe ſo very improbable a Story, as that K. <hi>James</hi> ſhould himſelf tell ſo great a Lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, to render himſelf the moſt Odious to <hi>England,</hi> that could poſſibly be Contrived: All the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertions, which his Enemies caſt upon Him, put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would not <hi>Blacken</hi> him ſo much, in the Eyes of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59238:99"/>
               <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> as ſuch a Deſign to Ruin their Trade, on purpoſe to let the <hi>French</hi> get it.</p>
            <p>And indeed it muſt raiſe a very ſtrange <hi>Idea</hi> of him to all People in the World; that a King could have ſo much ill Nature, ſo much Treachery, as to Ruin and Betray his own <hi>People,</hi> who were then very kind to him, on purpoſe to bring them into the Power of their Enemies; and that he ſhould be tranſported with ſuch an implacable Malice againſt them, as to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Ruin himſelf, to be Revenged on them, to make himſelf a Vaſſal to <hi>France,</hi> that they might become <hi>French</hi> Slaves: Which our Author ſayes is <hi>Evident,</hi> as I have before Quoted him.</p>
            <p>And that a King ſhould be ſo fond of this Character, as to Invent Lyes againſt himſelf, on purpoſe to have it believed!</p>
            <p>And to harden the Hearts of all <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> againſt Him, at the ſame time that He was Courting them; and as Dr. <hi>Gorges</hi>'s Letter tells us, ſpoke the kindeſt Things of them, upon all Occaſions, and as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in ſeveral places of this Book, that He Reckoned much upon His Friends in <hi>England!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (c. 3. near the end of §. 13.) that the <hi>Iriſh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> Refrained from Maſſacring the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> leſt <hi>It ſhould ſhock many of their Friends in</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>from whom they expected Great Matters.</hi> And that K. <hi>James depended on ſome</hi> Proteſtants <hi>in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>for Succour and Aſſiſtance, rather more than on the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judge then how probable it is that K. <hi>James</hi> ſhould Report ſuch things of himſelf, as He knew muſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt all theſe, and indeed all Honeſt Men?</p>
            <p>But the Author finds a Reaſon for it. <hi>It was,</hi> ſayes he, in his looſe Recantation, <hi>to incourage the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Nation into the Facility of Invading</hi> England.</p>
            <p>And was there no other way to do it, but for King <hi>James</hi> to tell ſo Scandalous a Lye of himſelf? And which my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and many others of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, beſides all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> knew to be falſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:59238:99"/>The chief Encouragement they had to come to <hi>England,</hi> was what our Author tells, the Friends they ſuppoſed they had eſpecially the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To whom this Account of King <hi>James,</hi> eſpecially from his own Mouth, would have been a ſtrange ſort of a Recommendation.</p>
            <p>But if that thing in which K. <hi>James</hi> was moſt to be admired, and took greateſt Pains, and which was moſt Viſible. (<hi>viz.</hi> his care of the <hi>Navy</hi>) can by this Author's Art, be thus turn'd into the Greateſt, and moſt Invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Objection againſt him, what fair Repreſentation of K. <hi>James</hi> can be expected from ſuch an Obſervator as as this? Or what Credit to any thing he has ſaid? Who would have you believe him, becauſe he takes God to Witneſs of his Sincere Repreſenting K. <hi>James</hi> and his Party in this Book: And even where he muſt Cenfeſs his Error, Repents, as you have ſeen.</p>
            <p>But we have been too long upon this. Pray God this Author's Repentance for this pretended Repentance and all other his Sins may be more ſincere and hearty before he Dye. And particularly that God may give him Grace to Repent Sincerely, and Confeſs Honeſtly all the Errors, Willful, or Malicious Repreſentations in this Book of his, with which I now proceed.</p>
            <p>C. 3. §. 12. p. 148. n. 6. He Reflects upon K. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Sincerity, who in his Anſwer to the Petition of the Lords for a Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> preſented 17. <hi>Nov.</hi> 88. gave it as one Reaſon why he could not Comply, <q>becauſe it was Impoſſible, whilſt part of the Kingdom was in the Enemies Hands to have a Free Parliament.</q> Thus he; and to make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him very exact, he qutoes the Kings Anſwer in the Margent, But on purpoſe leaves out thoſe Words, which would ſhew the Inference he makes from it to be very Inconſequential: his Inference is, <hi>That the ſame Impoſſibility lay on him</hi> (<hi>K.</hi> James) <hi>against holding a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>The Kings Words quoted in his Margent are theſe, <hi>How is it poſſible a Parliament ſhould be Free, in all its
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59238:100"/>Circumſtances, whilst an Enemy is in the Kingdom?</hi> There are but a very few Words more in that Anſwer, which are theſe. <hi>And can make a Return of near a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Voices.</hi> Theſe this Author leaves out. Was it for the length do you think? No, it would have quite Ruined his Plot, of making a Parallel 'twixt the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for K. <hi>James</hi>'s holding a Parliament in <hi>England</hi> 17. <hi>Nov.</hi> 88. and in <hi>Ireland, May</hi> 89. viz. <hi>That there was an Enemy in the Kingdom,</hi> which is indeed no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and none of the Reaſon the King gave. But ſuch an Enemy as can make a Return of <hi>near a Hundred Voices,</hi> would indeed hinder the Freedom of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in all its Circumſtances. Now let us ſee how many Voices the Enemy could Return in <hi>Ireland,</hi> not one but of two <hi>Burroughs,</hi> that is <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Enneskillen,</hi> all the other <hi>Burroughs,</hi> and all the <hi>Countys</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were in the Kings Hands. Now let our Author Judge of his Parallel, and of his Ingenuity, in Miſquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King's Anſwer. For he that does not tell the whole Truth that is Material, is a Falſe-witneſs. He ſays p. 152. <hi>Several Corporations had no Repreſentatives, becauſe they were in the Enemies Hands.</hi> And yet the whole Number is but <hi>two</hi> as aboveſaid. But he thought the Word <hi>ſeveral</hi> would carry more in the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Add to this the difference there is 'twixt a <hi>Forreign</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, being in the Country, and the <hi>Inſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Subjects.</hi> A Subject that Rebels, and will not Obey the King's Summons to Attend him in <hi>Parliament,</hi> is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Caſe from his being under a <hi>Forreign</hi> Power, that will not let him come. In the firſt Caſe, he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his Right to Sit in Parliament; and there is no reaſon that there ſhould not be a Parliament, becauſe he will not come. But in the other Caſe, it cannot be a <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Parliament, where ſo many <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> are under a Forreign Power. But our Author has proteſted before GOD, That he has not <hi>Aggravated</hi> nor <hi>Miſrepreſented</hi> any Thing, and therefore we muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That it was only to Save himſelf the pains of Writing, or his Reader of viewing theſe <hi>eight</hi> words,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59238:100"/>which he leaves out in the Kings Anſwer to the Lords; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>four</hi> Words <hi>ut Colonies ibi faciat,</hi> which he forgot in his Quotation out of <hi>Grotius,</hi> of which I made mention before; Tho' it is plain that both theſe Ommiſſions do quite alter the Sence of the Words our Author quotes, againſt that Interpretation which he would put upon them. And therefore it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that they were very <hi>Materially,</hi> and if I were not awed by this Authors ſerious appeal to God, I ſhould have ſaid <hi>Deſignedly</hi> omitted by this Author, to <hi>Miſrepreſent</hi> the Sence of both theſe Quotations, and for an <hi>Aggravation</hi> againſt K. <hi>James:</hi> But for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall only ſay this, That where this Author ſeems moſt Exact, and ſets his Quotations, as you would think, Verbatim in the Mangent, that you might ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing, as he does in theſe two Quotations of <hi>Grotius</hi> and K. <hi>James</hi>'s Anſwer to the Lords, there you are chiefly to ſuſpect, and you muſt ſtand upon your Guard.</p>
            <p>C. 1. n. 6. He brings another Quotation out of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, de Jure,</hi> &amp;c. l. 2. c. 25. n. 8. to ſhew, That <hi>Tho' Subjects might not take Arms Lawfully, even in the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt neceſſity— it would not follow from thence, that others might not take Arms in their behalf.</hi> I know no No-body that ſayes it would follow <hi>from thence.</hi> But as to his Quotation; <hi>Grotius</hi> ſayes in the very ſame place: That this pretence of Helping others, has, in all Ages, been made uſe of, to colour their Deſigns, who intend to Invade their Neighbors Right,<note place="margin">Scimus quidem ex Veterib. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſ<expan>

            <p>All this the Author has wiſely left out of his Quotation, it would have ſpoiled the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for which he brought it. But I cannot imagin to what end he ſets down another Quotation out of the ſame Book. Lib. 2. c. 20. §. 40. Where he tells us, <hi>That it is ſo much more Honourable to Avenge the Injuries done to another, than our ſelves, by how much there is leſs
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59238:101"/>Danger, that the ſenſe of anothers Pain ſhould make us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in exacting ſuch Revenge, than of our own, or Byaſs our judgment.</hi> By this Rule, he that Avenges the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to another, muſt have no <hi>By-Ends</hi> of his own, no <hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> accrue to himſelf by ſuch <hi>Revenge,</hi> elſe it may Byaſs his Judgment, and make him Exceed in his Revenge, <hi>viz.</hi> Inſtead of reducing his Neighbour to Reaſon, to Seize upon all he has for himſelf. How far this is Conducing to the End for which the Author produc'd it, I leave to himſelf to conſider.</p>
            <p>But I will make an end of this unſavory Subject, rak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Abſurdities and Contradictons into which a Mans Malice does betray him. I will give but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more upon this Head. You have heard before now poſitively he aſſerted that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were the <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſons</hi> in the late Revolution, that not one Proteſtant Acted any thing in oppoſition to the Government, but only defending themſelves againſt Robbers, nor Acted againſt theſe Robbers till actually. Aſſaulted by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you have it p. 105. Yet c. 3. §. 13. p. 178. (as it is printed, for it is wrong pag'd, it ought to be p. 186.) n. 4. He forgets this, and gives ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why the <hi>Iriſh</hi> papiſts <hi>Were not the Aggreſſors,</hi> as, <hi>That they lay under the ſtricteſt Obligations not to begin Acts of Cruelty, from the Odium, and Ill Succeſs their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in</hi> Forty One <hi>had. That the Proteſtants were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Cautious; not to give the leaſt offence,</hi> That it would hurt K. <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt in <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Matter is, he was here Anſwering the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>That very few Proteſtants l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For to repreſent a Man as the moſt Bigotted, and Mercileſs Tyrant, that deſign'd no leſs than the Total Extirpation of one main part of his people (upon which Suppoſition this Author Grounds his whole Book) and then, when he has Subdu'd theſe Subjects of his, and Red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe were the Greateſt Provocations can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and the Faireſt Occaſion given to ſuch a Cruel Tyrant to wreck his Malice upon thoſe whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to Deſtroy; And yet after Repreſenting a Man to be ſuch a Bloody Monſter, to find that he Kills none of theſe People, would make any Body ſuſpect he had not been ſairly Repreſented; and that he did not really deſign any ſuch thing as the Deſtruction of theſe People, at leaſt not altogether ſo fully as the <hi>French</hi> King reſolved the voiding the Edict of <hi>Nants.</hi> which this Author avers p. 19. I ſay, who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that K. <hi>James</hi> did as <hi>fully determin our Ruin,</hi> (as our Author there Words it) ſince he not only refuſed to do it, when it was in his Power, and he Apprehended ſo great Danger from them, but took Pains and uſed his utmoſt Authority to keep back others from doing it, who were ready and zealous to have done it, and thought it their Intereſt to do it? Therefore in this Diſtreſs our Author was obliged to find out ſome other Reaſons for this, beſides K. <hi>Jame</hi>'s Clemency: And a Man of leſs Ingenuity than his cou'd make a ſhift to find Reaſons for any thing; There is no Subject upon which ſomething may not be ſaid <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> and ſo here our Author contrives Reaſons for this Clemency of K. <hi>James,</hi> which may not ſpoil that Bloody Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he had given of him, and he turns it upon <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, Intereſt,</hi> not to Provoke <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> not foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſame Intereſt muſt remain while ever he was King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſecure the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and diſapoint this Authors whole Book. And likewiſe he was under a Neceſſity of Contradicting what he had ſaid before, of making the <hi>Iriſh</hi> the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylants and Murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he is now forced to give Reaſons why they were not ſo. You know who ſhould have good Memorys, and it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult when a Cauſe has ſeveral and Contrary Aſpects.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59238:102"/>It runs a Man ſome times to beſpatter that ſide which he means to Defend</p>
            <p>As truly I think has happened in the preſent Caſe: For if the moſt Malicious <hi>Jacobite</hi> had gone about to expoſe the preſent Government under the Name of K. <hi>James,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This Author Wounds the Preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Perſon of K. <hi>James</hi> and the Papiſts.</note> he could not have done it more effectually than it is done in this Book. For Example, when <hi>England</hi> found the old Oath of <hi>Supremacy</hi> inconſiſtent with the <hi>Preſent Settlement,</hi> they wiſely abrogated it, and made a new one.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ireland</hi> could not do this, wanting a Parliament; And in the Acts of Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there is a Penalty upon the refuſal of this Oath, which the then Civil and Military Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi> avoided, by ordering it ſo, That that Oath ſhould not be tender'd to them, as it was not at firſt to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary,</hi> nor to <hi>all</hi> the Civil Officers.</p>
            <p>Now ſee how our Author expoſes this Practice in the Perſon of the Papiſts. c. 2. p. 38. §. 9. He tells of an Horrible Artifice the Papiſts had to avoid the Oath enjoin'd on all Officers Civil and Military by Act. 28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. c. 13. and 2. <hi>Eliza.</hi> c. 1. <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>The Oath was never tender'd to their new Officers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſaid they, they never refuſed it, neither are they lyable to the Penalties of the Act. This was plainly againſt the deſign of the Statute, a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Words of it, and ſhewed us that Laws are Inſufficient to ſecure us againſt ſuch Jeſuitical Prevarications.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Author, not Conſidering that the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Prevarications muſt, by his Rule, be Charged not only upon the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants,</hi> as aboveſaid, but upon the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> in K. <hi>Williams</hi> Army, (who are many more in <hi>England,</hi> than K. <hi>James</hi> had in his Army here) and before the Alteration of the Oaths here by Act of Parliament; they muſt either have this ſame excuſe for avoiding theſe Oaths, or have none at all, p. 114. He ſays the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> choſe <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ly in Jayl, than take ſome new invented Oath that was put to them without any Law to enjoin it.</hi> Why
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59238:102"/>would not this Author tell us what Oath this was? I am told that there was no new Oath Impoſed upon the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland</hi> by K. <hi>James,</hi> and it is not very likely, where, as you have heard from the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and other Vouchers before Nam'd, K. <hi>James</hi> did not trouble the Proteſtants even with the Oaths enjoyn'd by Law.</p>
            <p>But I have been told that in <hi>Cork, Limerick,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Garriſons, upon the Sea Coaſt, where there were many <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> the Officers, without any Order from K. <hi>James,</hi> thought it reaſonable to take that Security of theſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (when they drew their Men out of theſe Garriſons into the Field, and when they were Alaram'd with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet) that theſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would not Joyn with their Enemies, but be true to K. <hi>J.</hi> And I am told likewiſe that none of theſe Proteſtants did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it. But if they did, as this Author ſays, could they take it ill to be ſecured in Priſon, who, when the Enemy was hourly expected, refuſed to promiſe not to Joyn with them, or betray the Garriſon to them? Secondly, this is an ill Reaſon for what the Author told us before, <hi>viz.</hi> That K. <hi>James</hi> had not the leaſt Reaſon to ſuſpect or Diſarm the Proteſtants; and therefore this Author calls it <hi>perfect Dragooning</hi> of them; as bad as was done in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Author tells his own Reaſon why they would rather ly in Jayl than take this Oath, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe <hi>there was not any Law to enjoyn it.</hi> and they thought this a Violation of the Law; and therefore that they ought to Suffer any hardſhip rather than Comply with it. For if you break one Law, you may break all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is perfect Wounding the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Condemning what the Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> even this Author himſelf has done <hi>viz.</hi> Taking an Oath of Fidelity to K. <hi>William</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary without any Law to enjoyn it.</hi> That is, before this late Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament for abrogating the Old Oaths of Allegiance, and Impoſing the new Oaths in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:59238:103"/>But here I muſt not be miſtaken, for I am not of our Author's Opinion, that there was no Law to enjoyn theſe Oaths. I have ſhewn before, That, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, there is an <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> may be required from the Subjects, which, for greater Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I have ſet down in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> n. 13. as it was Taken to K. <hi>J.</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> by theſe <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> With ſome Authorities out of the Common Law, to Juſtify the Legality of it. But our Author, either knew not this, or was willing not to remember it; and would rather Wound the <hi>preſent Government,</hi> than miſs ſuch a <hi>Blow,</hi> and Reflection upon the Government of K. <hi>J.</hi> whether this was done in the full ſincerity of his Heart, without Aggravation, or Miſrepreſenting againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> he has taken GOD to witneſs, and there we muſt leave it.</p>
            <p>The 26. <hi>Septemb.</hi> 90.

            <p>Another of theſe Proclamations Baniſh'd all Papiſts whatſoever, Ten Miles from the River <hi>Shannon,</hi> or any of their Majeſties Frontier Garriſons, on the ſame penalty.</p>
            <p>The Third forbids Sheltring, or Entertaining any <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſt whatſoever, but ſuch as they know to be under their Majeſties: Obedience, or of Correſponding with them, upon pain of High-Treaſon.</p>
            <p>And I have been told that there were many Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of this Sort in that Kingdom, ſome forbiding
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59238:103"/>them coming within ſo many Miles of any of Their Majeſties Garriſons, which were then very many; others Confining them to their Pariſhes and Citys; and not to ſtir above <hi>five</hi> Miles from their Dwelling Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were <hi>two</hi> Proclamations iſſued by K. <hi>W.</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> of the 17. <hi>June</hi> 90.

            <p>And ſuch things are neceſſary in times of War. But our Author takes upon him to Condemn all this as a Breach of the Liberty of the Subjects, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 95. where he inveighs againſt a <hi>Proclamation</hi> of K. <hi>J.</hi>'s, Dated 26. <hi>July</hi> 89. which Confin'd all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to their Pariſhes and Citys, as a very great Encroachment upon their Liberty, and a mighty <hi>inconvenience to their Affairs.</hi> [That was wiſely Obſerv'd]! And this is one of his Articles againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> which will ly equally againſt every King in the World, in time of War.</p>

            <p>I do not Argue againſt this as too ſevere: There may be reaſon for ſevere threatning; for after all, the King may extend his Mercy as he thinks fit.</p>
            <p>And this Author does not Alledge, that any Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in <hi>Ireland</hi> was put to Death by K. <hi>James</hi> for nor bringing in his Arms: Nor will he ſay, that they did all bring in their Arms: But confeſſes, as you have heard above, that they kept ſo many as were ſufficient <hi>to have fought the</hi> Iriſh, <hi>and to have beat them too.</hi> And ſure ſome of theſe might have been found out if K. <hi>James</hi> had ſought that Occaſion to take away their lives. And this Author's Naming none of the Proteſtants, who were put to Death upon this Account, is firſt a Demonſtration that there was none ſo put to Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this Author would have heard of it, and would not have miſt telling it. And ſecondly, it is a great Vindication of K. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Clemency,</hi> that he did not take this Advantage againſt them.</p>
            <p>But the uſe I have to make of it, upon the Head I am now treating, is, that this Author Wounds the preſent Government in the Perſon of K. <hi>James;</hi> For how could he more effectually Expoſe, and Arraign K. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Proclamation, making the Penalty of not bringing in Arms to be Death; than by making it one of the Inſtances of K. <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Illegal Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> that he Iſſu'd a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> making the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of not bringing in Arms to be Death? How could this Author have Expos'd K. <hi>William</hi> more? Or ſhewn his own partiality in this Hiſtory of his, while he Condemns that in one, which he Juſtifys in another? Was there no <hi>Favour or Affection to a Party</hi> in this? He takes GOD to Witneſs there was not, of which we ſhall come to Diſcourſe preſently. But now we go on with the Subject in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> The Reflections this Author Caſts upon the preſent Government, in his manner of Repreſenting the Carriage of K. <hi>James</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> What he ſays, p. 130. n. 4. of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> being forced to take out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59238:104"/>and pay for them, and then having them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd, and paying for new ones in ſome other Method, looks perfectly like <hi>Lampooning</hi> the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Ireland,</hi> Who have forced all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to take Protections, and pay ſo much for them, and then Recall them, and put it into other Hands to Grant new Protections, over and over again: In <hi>March</hi> 1690/1. All Protections were Recall'd, except thoſe Granted by the General, and all required to take new Protections from the going Judges of Aſſize, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2 Pence a piece; and I have heard that in one County <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Meath</hi> there were ten or twelve Thouſand Protections given by the Judges. So that this was a Comfortable Circuit!</p>
            <p>The reaſon for the often altering theſe <hi>Protections</hi> was given becauſe they ſaid that many <hi>Iriſh</hi> were kill'd with theſe <hi>Protections</hi> in their pockets, which argued the greateſt Treachery in them, and that they took theſe <hi>Protections</hi> only to impoſe upon the Government.</p>
            <p>But nor Author vindicates them in all this, at leaſt clears them from our Objecting it to them, while he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 172. <q>That K. <hi>J.</hi> rail'd, on this occaſion, againſt <hi>Protestants</hi> in general, repreſenting them as falſe and perfidious; For, ſaid he, many were kill'd with my Protections in their pockets; not Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>(O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when Men were thus Slaughter'd with his Approbation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his <hi>Protections</hi> in their pockets, it was but reaſonable for ſuch as ſurviv'd to think of ſome other way of <hi>Protecting</hi> their Lives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Author, and infers that they were kill'd with the King's Approbation, who were kill'd with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>Protections</hi> in their pockets. This I have ſpoke to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. And the Conſequence he draws from it, would Juſtify the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who Survive to ſeek ſome other way of <hi>Protecting</hi> their Lives, than the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus excellently does our Author argue!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:59238:105"/>Now Imagine he had ſuch a Story as <hi>Glencoe</hi> to tell of any of King <hi>James</hi>'s, Officers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> how eaſily cou'd he, by his Art, make it Reflect upon the King himſelf, and abſolve all thoſe <hi>High-landers</hi> from their Allegiance, and give them leave to Protect their Lives another way? O what Declamations we ſhould have had of the Bloody <hi>Iriſh, Cut-Throats, Maſſacrers, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And what uſe would he have made of their giving it under their Hands, that what they did was by the Kings Expreſs Command, and none Puniſh'd for it! He would never have given K. <hi>James</hi> Liberty to Deny it, or make any Defence, but would have Repreſented to the Three Kingdoms what they were to Expect from him, who could give ſuch Orders, exceeding in in Cruel Barbarity the Wild <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or <hi>Tartars.</hi> He would have made more of this, than of all the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rys he has Collected in his Book, if they were all true.</p>
            <p>But his Zeal muſt be Commended. p. 206. n. 8. where he reckons, as a means of Deſtroying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, the Debauchery and univerſal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners that then prevail'd. Take his own Words. p. 207. <hi>The Perjuries in the Courts, the Robberys in the Country, the Lewd Practices in the Stews, the Oaths, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>laſphemys, and Curſes, in the Armys and Streets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And theſe indeed are a means to Deſtroy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Proteſtant, but any Chriſtian Religion. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wiſh (as I hear one did) that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army were more Guilty of this than the Proteſtant Army. But that theſe are Increas'd, beyond former Examples, in the Proteſtant Army, all of them that retain the leaſt ſenſe of Religion, do bemoan with Regret; but I have mentioned this already. I am ſure it can be no good Religion, which is promoted by theſe Means, or ſuffers them, to ſecure any Intereſt whatſoever. God does not need our <hi>Vertue,</hi> much leſs our <hi>Vices</hi> to help him to Govern the World. And he will not be ſerv'd by the Breach of his Commands. <hi>Can we expect</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Gorge</hi> in his Letter) <hi>Sodom to deſtroy Babylon, or
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59238:105"/>Debauchery to deſtroy Popery? Our Enemy</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Fights with the Principle of a Miſtaken Conſcience againſt us, we againſt the Conviction of our Principles against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might inlarge upon this Subject. But to returne to our Author. He ſpeaks with Juſt Indignation. p. 173. againſt General <hi>Roſen</hi>'s Stratagem of bringing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in that Country before the Walls of <hi>Derry,</hi> and to threaten to Deſtroy them all, if the City would not receive them, which would have brought a Famine into the Town, and forced them to Surrender. I need not take pains againſt the Barbarity of this deſign: For K. <hi>James</hi> expreſs'd his Juſt Reſentment of it, and Countermanded it upon the firſt notice. And in his Circular Letters to the Governors of Towns, and Officers Commanding in chief in the North, to whom theſe Orders of <hi>Roſens</hi> had come, he Commands them by no means to obey theſe Barbarous Orders of <hi>Roſen</hi>'s: And accordingly <hi>Roſen</hi>'s Orders for the Driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not Executed in moſt places in the North. This I have from the Officers to whom theſe Orders were ſent; and from ſeveral Proteſtants who have ſeen them, and can produce them.</p>
            <p>But our Author diſcovers his skill in War, when he ſays <hi>that he never met with any thing like it in History; nor do I believe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it was ever Practis'd by any Nation, unleſs the</hi> French <hi>have uſed it in their late Wars.</hi> Many inſtances might be given him of as Barbarous Exploits in War, particularly, that of Reducing places by Famine. But to ſpeak Impartially, Is not Starving a <hi>County,</hi> or a <hi>Province,</hi> as Barbarous as Starving a <hi>City?</hi> And was not Crowding all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children over the River <hi>Shannon</hi> done on purpoſe to reduce them to Famine? And it had its effect, and many of them Dyed, and Women Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many were Starv'd in that <hi>Driving</hi> over the <hi>Shannon,</hi> inſomuch that ſome of the Proteſtant Officers, who were employed on that Expedition, expreſſed the greateſt Regret, to ſee ſuch Lamentable Spectacles, and were aſham'd of their Commiſſions. And thoſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59238:106"/>who were thus Driven, had King <hi>William</hi>'s Protections in their pockets.</p>
            <p>In expoſing theſe things, our Author ſhould take care not to Wound the Government, through the Sides of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> But his Zeal carry'd him too far, where, in the Heads of his Diſcourſe, he makes this one, That when the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> apply'd to King <hi>James,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Driving, King <hi>James,</hi> he ſayes, excus'd <hi>Roſen:</hi> And when you turn to the Book, to ſee this made out, p. 174. All you find, is, that King <hi>James</hi> told the Biſhop, <hi>That he had ſent Orders to ſtopt it, and if he</hi> (Roſen) <hi>had been his own Subject, he would have call'd him to Account for it.</hi> This is a ſtrange way of excuſing him! But it ſhews how ſharp-ſighted this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is in finding Faults. You may be ſure, by this, that none have eſcaped him. Nor can he ſpare them, even where it plainly Reflects upon the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he pretends to Complement.</p>
            <p>But this is only by <hi>Innuendos.</hi> Tho' he has brought it ſo near, as to make the Application very eaſie.</p>

He would Limit that Prerogative of the Crown, of Coyning Money, and by his Quotation in the Margent, would take it quite away, giving the King no power <hi>To change his Money, nor impair, nor inhanſe, nor make any Money, but of Silver, without the Aſſent of the Lords, and all the Commons.</hi> Yet he cannot forget
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59238:106"/>to have heard of <hi>Leather</hi> Money Coyn'd in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>past-board</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he diſcovers what he would be at, To Depreſs the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> even to a <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> And <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary Monarchy,</hi> muſt be the Conſequence of dividing the Intereſt of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and ſetting them up to Fight againſt one another, to Watch and Guard againſt one another, as the Greateſt Enemies, that if one prevail, the other muſt be deſtroyed. <hi>A Kingdom divided</hi> — Mat. 12.25.</p>
            <p>This is not altogether ſo pleaſant a proſpect as the <hi>Paſſive-Obedience-Men</hi> afford us, while they repreſent the <hi>Prerogative</hi> as the greateſt Safe-guard of the Rights and Priviledges of the People.

            </p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible of the many ill Steps were made in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Government, and above all, of the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Conſequence of the Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; which, the moſt of any one thing, brought on the Misfortunes of his Maſter.</p>
            <p>But when, by what means ſoever, things were brought to that paſs, that K. <hi>James</hi> was deſerted by <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> no Man, in his Senſes, can blame him, for making uſe of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> nor my Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> for Arming, Inliſting, Arraying them <hi>&amp;c. In doing whereof (conſidering the great Truſt repoſed in him) no man of Honour, or Moral Honesty can truly blame him.</hi> Says my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> as inſerted by this Author. p. 349. And this Author knows very well that Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> was a firm <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant,</hi> and a Man of Senſe.</p>
            <p>And this Author does Confeſs. p. 101. n. 5. That theſe new made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> were ſet on Foot, partly on the firſt Noiſe of the P. of <hi>Orange</hi>'s deſcent, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the beginning of <hi>Decem.</hi> 88.</p>
            <p>Now at this time to hinder K. <hi>James</hi> to raiſe an Army of <hi>Iriſh</hi> to aſſiſt him is the Argument our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had undertaken, and for which he blackens K. <hi>James</hi> to the utmoſt. He ſays, p. 166. <q>That <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Neceſſity at all,</hi> he (K. <hi>James</hi>) threw himſelf upon theſe People, he Encourag'd them, he Armed them, gave Commiſſions, <hi>even to thoſe that had been Torys, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Some ſuch perhaps he might Employ, (I have known a High-way-Man an Officer in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. time, and no Notice taken of it) but it was becauſe he could get no better, as is ſaid above. But to ſay he had <hi>no Neceſſity at all</hi> to raiſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59238:107"/>theſe Men, cannot have common Sence in it, unleſs this Author thinks, that at that time the <hi>Protestants</hi> of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> would have Fought for K. <hi>James</hi> againſt the P. of <hi>Orange,</hi> and ſo that he had no need of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> If that be our Authors meaning, I hope he will Explain himſelf. And likewiſe, whether he does not a little Aggravate the Caſe (which he proteſt before GOD he does not) when he aſſures us. p. 15. <hi>That</hi> K. <hi>James did Proſecute the ſame, if not worſe Methods towards the Protestants in</hi> Ireland, <hi>than the K. of</hi> France <hi>did with the Hugonots in his Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why? Was there any <hi>Dragooning</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſuch as we have heard of in <hi>France?</hi> Yes: Our Author tells us. C. 3. §. 8. n. 15. p. 112. <hi>This was perfect Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning to the Proteſtants — Terrible Dragooning!</hi> Pray what was this? It muſt raiſe a Diſmal Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in the Reader, ſome Exquiſit Torture! <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Bridles!</hi> or ſome-thing like <hi>Amboina! Parturiunt Montes.</hi> — The whole matter was <hi>Diſarming</hi> the Proteſtants in <hi>Dublin.</hi> 24. <hi>Feb.</hi> 88. But what Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there for this Diſarming? What Reaſon had the Government to be Apprehenſive of theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants? All the Proteſtants Generally in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noght,</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> in all <hi>Ireland</hi> (except <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Linſter,</hi> whom the. Lord Deputy kept in Awe, with what Forces he had) were then actually in Armes in Oppoſition to the Government, and had enter'd into <hi>Aſſociations</hi> to carry on their War.</p>
            <p>But may be theſe Proteſtants in <hi>Dublin</hi> were more Loyal than the other Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland.</hi> What Reaſon had the Lord Deputy to Suppoſe that?</p>
            <p>But this Author tells us in the ſame Section. p. 97. That they had a Plot to Seize my Lord Deputy himſelf, and the Caſtle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> with the Stores, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when was this? It was, ſays the Author, <hi>when the News came that K.</hi> James <hi>had ſent Commiſſioners to Treat with the P. of</hi> Orange. This was very early. And what if the <hi>

                  </gap>d</hi> of a Treaty?
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59238:108"/>How did they know but the King and Prince might have Agreed? But they were reſolv'd to Anticipate all this: And not to wait even the Princes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. They were for Supererogation, and to ſhew Zeal <hi>Extraordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all, if their Numbers were not Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Proportion to the Kings Army, or if they were not well Arm'd, the Government might have over look'd their Raſhneſs, and let them alone. In Anſwer to this, our Author tells in the ſame Place; <hi>That they</hi> (<hi>K.</hi> Jame's <hi>Army</hi>) <hi>were but a Handful to the Proteſtants, there being Men and Arms Enough in</hi> Dublin <hi>alone, to have dealt with them.</hi> And p. 111. That they (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) had Arms enough <hi>to make the Papiſts Afraid, and to beat them too, if they had had a little Aſſiſtance and Encouragement of Authority to Attempt it.</hi> And they knew how to Supply the want of Authority another way.</p>
            <p>Now let any one Judge in the point of Reaſon. Is there a Man in his Senſes, that had to do with theſe People, in the Circumſtances they, and the reſt of the Proteſtants of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſtood, but would have <hi>Diſarm'd</hi> them if he could?</p>
            <p>And for our Author to Equal this to the <hi>French Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning,</hi> is betraying of his Cauſe: It is rendring the whole Suſpected. To Aggravate things beyond the Truth, does not make them more, but nothing at all. What Notion does this give us of the <hi>French</hi> Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Had that King as much to ſay againſt the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> as K. <hi>James</hi> had againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> Did the <hi>French</hi> King uſe them no Worſe than K. <hi>James</hi> did theſe Proteſtants? Our Author ſays, as above, that K. <hi>James</hi> uſed worſe Methods, towards the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> than the King of <hi>France</hi> did with the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> If ſo Mounſieur <hi>Claud</hi> has mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Misinform'd us in his Account of the Perſecution of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince our Author will have this Compariſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not think of another would Render K. <hi>James</hi> ſo Odious, I have a Curioſity to know his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59238:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>as to the Cauſe of theſe <hi>Hugonots, viz.</hi> Whether their King's breaking the Edict of <hi>Nants,</hi> and uſing them as he did, was Sufficient to abſolve them from their Allegiance, and to ſet up a King of their own Religion, where-ever they could find him? I doubt not, but this Author will Anſwer in the Affirmative; and that it was nothing but want of Power kept them from <hi>Abdicating</hi> that King, who they thought had <hi>Abdicated</hi> the Government of them, by his ill uſage of them: And this will be a better Plea for the <hi>French</hi> King, to Rid himſelf of theſe ſort of People, than any I have yet heard offered for him.</p>
            <p>But in this Compariſon 'twixt King <hi>James,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, our Author makes King <hi>James</hi> the more wicked Man of the <hi>Two,</hi> uſing worſe Method with his Proteſtants, as you have heard. And in his Character of the <hi>French</hi> King, he gives him the Advantage over King <hi>James,</hi> with an <hi>Innuendo-reflection</hi> upon King <hi>James</hi> in this ſame place, p. 14. He reports the <hi>French</hi> King to be a <hi>Merciful Man in his own Nature, and certainly,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a mighty Zealot for his Honour.</hi> As if King <hi>James</hi> were not ſo, indeed he was far from it, as this Author repreſents him.</p>
            <p>You ſee to what a Height this Authors Zeal has car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him, when he will give ſo fair a Character, even of the <hi>French</hi> King, that he may thereby blacken K. <hi>J.</hi> the more.</p>
            <p>And upon this Head, I hope no Man will take it ill, at leaſt to do Right to K. <hi>James,</hi> Would any Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to be worſe than the <hi>French</hi> King!</p>
            <p>Therefore give me leave to ſay, (and in this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall have the Major part on my ſide) That if the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> had Invited a <hi>Forreign Hugonot</hi> Prince to enter <hi>France</hi> with an Army, had joyn'd with him, and Proclaim'd him for their King; and Forc'd K. <hi>Lewis</hi> to Fly out of <hi>France;</hi> and afterward reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering part of his own, he ſhould reduce the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>Brettaigne,</hi> for example, and they, when they were come again under the Power of their Old Maſter, ſhould ſhew all the Signs of Diſloyalty, and Diſaffection to him, Deſerting him every day, to their new <hi>Hugonot</hi>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:59238:109"/>King, and giving an Account to him of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in them, that could not make their Eſcape from K. <hi>Lewis;</hi> and K. <hi>L.</hi> to know all this, and that thoſe that ſtaid, gave all the Intelligence they could to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and did all the Miſchief they could to him their <hi>Natural</hi> King, under whoſe Protection they then Liv'd: And thoſe of them that were able in <hi>Brettaigne</hi> to hold out in open Arms againſt him, keeping <hi>two</hi> Towns in the ſame Province he had Reduc'd, where they Fortify'd themſelves, and Declared for their <hi>Hugonot</hi> King, and to Reſcue thoſe <hi>Hugonots</hi> that were under King <hi>Lewis</hi> —</p>
            <p>I ſay, if this had been the Caſe 'twixt K. <hi>Lewis</hi> and the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> I believe I ſhall have the Major part of <hi>England</hi> of my Opinion, That King <hi>Lewis</hi> would have dealt otherwiſe with them, than King <hi>James</hi> did with the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And perhaps, had any King in Chriſtendom, but K. <hi>James,</hi> had them in his Power (as he had for a whole Summer) he would not have left them in a Capacity to have Driven him out of the Kingdom, as they did: And he was Morally aſſured they would do ſo, when it was in his Power to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them.</p>
            <p>But rather than Deſtroy them, he put it in their Power to Deſtroy him; which they did without the leaſt ſenſe of all his Goodneſs to them, which they Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to own, but purſued him as a Tyrant. Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Gorge</hi> Aſſures us, in his Large Letter, that the <hi>Iriſh Proteſtants</hi> were more Active againſt King <hi>James,</hi> and were more dreaded by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> than any other of K. <hi>William</hi>'s Army.</p>
            <p>If K. <hi>James</hi> were as great a ſtranger to us, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the Scene were plac'd as far off as thoſe Times, yet who would not have a Zeal to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Truth! who would not be mov'd to ſee a King, who ſuffered himſelf to be viſibly Ruin'd by his unprovocable Clemency to <hi>Obſtinate Rebels,</hi> repreſented by them, for ſo doing, as the <hi>Bloodiest Tyrant</hi> in the World! To ſee this Authors Book Tranſport Men ſo far, without examining, as that the Principal Secretary of State ſhould Licenſe a Pamphlet, call'd, <hi>The Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

And therefore it is Incumbent upon our Author, to produce ſome Catalogue of theſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who remain'd <hi>Loyal</hi> to King <hi>James</hi> while he was there (except thoſe few who were in his Army, whom our Author, or our Phamphleteer cannot mean, becauſe they reckon theſe among the number of the <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and by ſome thought worſe of than the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for Aſſiſting the <hi>Papiſts</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) we deſire a <hi>Liſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Loyal Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who ſuffered any thing from King <hi>James,</hi> while he was there. Can this Author find ſo many as their were <hi>Righteous</hi> Men in <hi>Sodom?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is much more certain, that King <hi>James</hi>'s Mercy to the <hi>Diſloyal Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> put them in a Capacity to help to Drive him out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for his pains.</p>
            <p>Does this Author really believe, That King <hi>Lewis</hi> would have uſed them as kindly as King <hi>James</hi> did, while he knew they were Plotting, and would Joyn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him?</p>
            <p>I Appeal to this Author, Whether he would have thought himſelf ſo Secure in King <hi>Lewis</hi>'s hands, if he had been betraying his Councils, and giving Intelligence to his Enemies, as he was, under theſe Circumſtances, in King <hi>James</hi>'s Power?</p>
            <p>But our Author never fails to make a round Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. That King <hi>James</hi> ſhould not be ſo Good a Man as King <hi>Lewis,</hi> is not ſo great a Matter. But now our Author's hand is in, you ſhall ſee him carry King <hi>James</hi>'s Character to be full as Inhumane as that of the <hi>Great Turk</hi> himſelf.

I ſhall alſo moſt readily conſent to the making ſuch good and wholſome Laws as may be for the general Good of the Nation, the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trade, and the Relieving ſuch as have been injured by the late Acts of Settlement, as far forth as may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Reaſon, Juſtice, and the publick Good of my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And as I ſhall do my part to make you happy and rich; ſo I make no doubt of your Aſſiſtence by enabling Me to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the unjuſt Deſigns of my Enemies, and to make this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion flourish. And to encourage you the more to it, you know with how great Generoſity and Kindneſs the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> gave a ſecure Retreat to the Queen, my Son, and my Self, when we were forced out of <hi>England,</hi> and came to ſeek Protection and Safety in his Dominions; how he embraced my Intereſt, and gave ſuch Supplies of all forts, as enabled Me to come to you, which without his obliging Aſſiſtence I could not have done: This he did at a time when he had ſo many and ſo conſiderable Enemies to deal with; and you ſee ſtill continues to do. I shall conclude as I began, and aſſure you, I am as ſenſible as you can deſire Me, of the ſignal Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty you have expreſt to Me, and shall make it my chief Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as it always has been, to make you and all my Subjects happy.</p>

                     <hi>THe Fire,</hi> ſaith the Royal Prophet, <hi>kindled in my Breaſt, and I ſpake with my Tongue:</hi> Perhaps ſome Sparks of that Fire ſo enflamed my Zeal to the publick Good of this Countrey, that I have not onely ſpoke with my Tongue, but wrote with my Pen thoſe Truths which I know have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounded more to my particular Prejudice, than to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service. He that follows Truth too near, ſaith a wiſe man, may loſe his Teeth; and a wiſer than he tells us, that he who profeſſeth ſome Truths, may thereby loſe his Life; yet in the ſame Period tells us, that he shall be no loſer thereby; the Satisfaction and Contentment which conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attends Integrity, being much ſweeter than the Advantage of Temporal Security. <hi>Liberavi Animam meam,</hi> and if this make me vile, I am content to be more vile: I know God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59238:113"/>hath put Enmity between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent; and I as well know, that it is as vain for Man's Prudence to attempt to unite what God hath divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as it is ſinfull to divide what he hath united. I ſpeak not a little to my ſatisfaction, what you know to be true, That our Adverſaries, who are more God's than ours, want neither Power nor Malice to crush us; ſuch is the Goodneſs of God, that they dare not own their Hatred; but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not only to make me fall from my preſent Station, ſoft and eaſie; but are willing to make my Remove an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to me; little thinking, that taking me off from being Secretary to the General, and making me Secretary of State, neceſſitates one of my Principles to be the more prejudicial to theirs: You know that notwithſtanding all their publick and private Oppoſition, <hi>They are come up to many of our Principles, and we ſtill continue our Diſtance to theirs;</hi> which for the better memory I ſhall enumerate in the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, the better to obtain your Belief in other particulars, which I ſhall here ſubjoin.</p>
                  <p>You know that I ever aſſerted, that thoſe Principles and Practices which God bleſſed with Succeſs in the former <hi>Iriſh</hi> War, were moſt like to have the ſame ſucceſs in this, which I told you were as followeth:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Though the <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> had then, as appears by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Preface to the <hi>Act of Settlement,</hi> made that Rebellion the moſt horrid and univerſal, as ever befell this Kingdom; and that nothing but the final Extirpation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Laws, Religion, and Government was deſigned and endeavoured by that War: Yet the then <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government thought not fit to tread in their Steps, but ſtill declined ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the War either National or Religious; and did declare, and, as you know, made their Declaration good at the end of the War, That thoſe of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts as could prove their conſtant good Affection to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, as many then did, were as ſecure in their Properties, as any of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation or Religion; and by this means ſo divided their Intereſt, that Sir <hi>Ch. Coote</hi>'s Northern Army was moſt of it compoſed of <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, who fought faithfully and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully againſt their Countreymen, and many yet living know
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59238:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>faithfully the White Knight of <hi>Kerry</hi> and others as Eminent as he, ſerved General <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. By publick Proclamation in thoſe times, they protected <hi>Papiſts</hi> and well as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who would live peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Government, from any violence to be done them by the Soldiers; two private Soldiers being publickly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the face of the whole Army, for ſtealing two Hens from an <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> not worth ſix pence, for violating the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, the firſt day General <hi>Cromwell</hi> made his advance from <hi>Dublin</hi> towards <hi>Droghedagh.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. They forbid, under the like penalty of death without mercy, any contempt or violation of the Lord General's publick Orders and Proclamations,</item>
                     <item>4. They prohibited all free quartering on the Countrey, or any Soldiers quartering without Billets from the Conſtable, and would not ſuffer any Soldier to quarter himſelf.</item>
                     <item>5. They likewiſe under ſevere penalties forbid private Soldiers ſtragling from their Colours without Paſſes, and ordered both Civil and Military Magiſtrates to apprehend ſuch ſtraglers, to ſend them to their Colours, then to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to their reſpective merits.</item>
                     <item>6. They gave great Encouragement to <hi>Papiſts</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who would give Hoſtages for their fidelity, and joyn with them.</item>
                     <item>7. They ſeverely puniſhed all open Debauchery and Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and would frequently affirm, that good Conduct was more uſually bleſs'd with ſucceſs, than courage of Armies.</item>
                     <item>8. Though they protected, as aforeſaid, <hi>Papiſts</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> from the Soldiers violence, yet they left both to be Fin'd, Impriſon'd, or Sequeſter'd by the Civil Magiſtrates, according to their reſpective merits.</item>
                     <item>9. Both Officers and Soldiers were required to be aiding and aſſiſting to put in execution all Orders or Directions of the Civil Magiſtrate, eſpecially ſuch as referred to the well management of the publick Revenue.</item>
                     <item>10. They laboured all they could to leſſen the Charge of <hi>England,</hi> and to encreaſe the publick Revenue of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>11. On aſſurance of punctual performance, they contented themſelves with four days pay in a week, and placed the other three days to be paid out of forfeited Lands.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59238:114"/>Laſtly, By this Abatement of their Pay, and leaving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels Goods, Stock, and Lands, and the publick Revenue to be improved by the Civil Magiſtrate, and making the Soldiers duly pay for their quarters, they ſoon raiſed in this Kingdom a Revenue, which bore a moity of the charge of the War.</p>
                  <p>I might enumerate many other particulars, which having been the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of my Diſcourſe with your ſelf, and ſome late Letters I have wrote to Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> I intentionally decline. You know how often and how early we preſſed the neceſſity of reſtoring a <hi>Civil Government</hi> in this Province, and how often and openly we declared that the ruine of the Countrey muſt be the prejudice, and endanger the ruine of the Army; and that there could be found no hands ſo cheap and eaſie to be got, or any that would be more hearty and faithfull than the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, who having their particular Intereſts ſeconded by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Religious motives, muſt be more zealous in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this War, than any foreign or mercenary Soldiers, as is evident by what has been done by the <hi>London-derry</hi> and <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillen</hi> Soldiers, who are and were made up of the meaneſt and loweſt People of this and the neighbouring Provinces. You cannot forget who offered, and that at their own charge on our firſt landing here, to block up <hi>Charlemont,</hi> and to raiſe Regiments to ſecure the <hi>Northern Gariſons,</hi> that the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Army, might have the more leiſure to attend the motions of the publick Enemy; and I preſume you cannot but as well remember, who ridiculed, ſcorned, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all motions of that kind, and who affirmed, and that openly, that the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of this Province, ought rather to be treated as Enemies than Friends, and that the beſt of them had either baſely complied with K. <hi>J.</hi> and his Party, or cowardly left and deſerted their Countrey; that the Goods and Stocks of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> inhabitants, once ſeized by the Enemy, were forfeited, and ought not to be reſtored, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as encouragement to the Soldiers; that all <hi>Papiſts</hi> ought to be plundred, and none protected; that the reſtoration of Civil Government was a diminution of the power of the General and the Army, and that all the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Province were falſe to the preſent <hi>Government,</hi> and ought not to be truſted with places of Truſt or Power;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59238:114"/>that as their Perſons were not to be truſted, ſo their Oaths and Complaints were neither to be believed nor redreſſed; that ſo an eaſier and a ſafer approach might be made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the little left them by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That all endeavours of the ſettlement of a publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue were deſigns to oppreſs the Army; that free quartering was the leaſt retaliation that <hi>Protestants</hi> could give for being reſtored to their former Eſtates; that Religion is but Cant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Debauchery the neceſsary Character of Soldiers. If to theſe you add the Preſſing of Horſes at pleaſure, Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at pleaſure, Robbing and Plundering at pleaſure, denying the People Bread or Seed of their own Corn, though the General by his publick <hi>Proclamation</hi> requires both, and ſome openly and publickly contemning and ſcorning the ſaid <hi>Proclamation;</hi> whereby multitudes of Families are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reduced to want of Bread, and left only to beg, or ſteal, or ſtarve. Theſe being the <hi>Practices,</hi> and theſe the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and both as well known to you as to me; can it be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the oppreſsed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> here ſhould report us worſe than the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or can it be wondered that God ſhould purſue us with his dreadfull Judgments who have ſo provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with our daring ſins? Or can we rationally expect <hi>God</hi> ſhould fight for us, while we thus fight againſt him? We may as well expect <hi>Grapes</hi> from <hi>Thornes</hi> and <hi>Figs</hi> from <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> as ſucceſs to a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe from ſuch hands. Can we expect <hi>Sodom</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Debauchery</hi> to deſtroy <hi>Popery?</hi> Our Enemy fights with the <hi>Principle</hi> of a miſtaken Conſcience againſt us, we againſt the conviction of our own <hi>Principles</hi> againſt them. What I have learned of the Enemies <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> ſince I left you, I ſhall here inform you, and reduce what I have to ſay to theſe two general heads.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The frequent Diſcourſe of their King.</item>

                     </item>

                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59238:115"/>2. He is heard often to deſire his Officers, <hi>That in their Engagement with the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>they ſhould be treated as miſtaken Subjects, and not as obſtinate Rebels.</hi>
                     </item>

                     </item>

                     </item>
                     <item>5. He is often heard to complain, <hi>That he ever obſerved, an aptitude and propenſity in Perſons of Power to perſecute ſuch as differ from them.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. <hi>That this natural aptitude to perſecute, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by wholeſome and effectual Laws.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>7. <hi>That this perſecuting Spirit influencing the greater number of all Perſwaſions, eſpecially Perſons in Power, is the only cauſe of his Majeſty's preſent Sufferings.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>8. He is paſſionately kind to all Deſerters, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives and ſoon prefers them.</item>
                     <item>9. He pretending his Sufferings to be thus on the account of Conſcience, ſeems not to doubt, but God will find ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected means, for his Reſtauration, in 1690. as he did in 1660.</item>
                     <item>10. He is heard frequently to declare againſt the <hi>Dragoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſecution</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the barbarous and inhumane Murders committed on the Proteſtants of this Kingdom in the year 1641. as paſſionately, and perhaps as ſincerely as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did againſt their forefathers for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the Prophets. To theſe I think fit to add the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his Majeſty's publick Declarations, which are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be read once every two months in the head of every Troop and Company in his whole Army, and to be fixed up in all the <hi>Boroughs</hi> and <hi>Market-Towns</hi> in this Kingdom.
<list>
                           <item>1. His Majeſty is pleaſed earneſtly to recommend the performance of publick and private Duties to God, to all under his command, and particularly recommends to the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> of his Army frequent Confeſſions, and ſtrict obſervation of <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holy-days.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. He publickly declares what ſubſiſtance he allows to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Horſe, Dragoon, and every private Soldier in his Army, and what is reſerved in the Pay-Maſter's hands for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements and the Hoſpital.</item>

                           <item>4. He ſtrictly requires the private Soldier out of the ſaid Subſiſtence duly and truly to pay his Quarters.</item>
                           <item>5. In caſe they ſhall want their Subſiſtence, they are then required every week to give their reſpective Landlords a Note under their hands, which ſhall be received by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver General, as ſo much Money out of any Branch of His Majeſty's Revenue.</item>
                           <item>6. His Majeſty forbids all ſtragling of private Soldiers from their Garriſons without their Officers Paſs; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires all Officers, either Military or Civil, to apprehend ſuch Soldiers having no Paſs, and to ſend them to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to receive puniſhment according to their demerits.</item>
                           <item>7. His Majeſty by the ſame <hi>Proclamation,</hi> forbids all <hi>Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> on any pretence whatſoever, under pain of death without Mercy.</item>
                           <item>8.

                           <item>9. He forbids all Officers and Soldiers to quarter themſelves on any of His Majeſty's Subjects, without having a Billet or Ticket under the hand of the Conſtable or other Civil Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Place.</item>
                           <item>10. He ſtrictly forbids Preſſing any Countrey-man's Horſe on any pretence whatſoever, without having His Majeſty, his Captain General, his Lord Lieutenant, or Deputy-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's Licenſe for his ſo doing; and then allows them to Preſs the ſaid Horſe but one days Journey, and to ſee that the Horſe be returned as well as when received; and particularly forbids the Preſſing any Horſe belonging to any Plough.</item>
                           <item>11. His Majeſty in the ſame <hi>Proclamation,</hi> enjoyns ſevere penalties on all foreſtallers or obſtructers of Proviſion going to either Camp or Market.</item>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59238:116"/>Offenders. My Family tells me, that the week be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they left <hi>Dublin,</hi> there were two private Soldiers execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Baker's door, for ſtealing two Loaves not worth a Shilling. And a fortnight before, a Lieutenant and Enſign were publickly executed at a place, where on pretence of the King's Service, they Preſs'd a Horſe going with Proviſions to <hi>Dublin</hi> Market; two others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and expected daily to be executed for the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: Theſe ſevere examples confirming the penalties of theſe publick <hi>Declarations,</hi> contribute ſo much to the quiet of the Countrey, that were it not for the Countrey <hi>Rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rees</hi> and <hi>Tories,</hi> theirs, 'tis thought, would be much quieter than ours. Some of our Foreigners are very uneaſie to us; had not the prudence of a diſcreet Major prevented it, laſt <hi>Sunday</hi> was ſeven night had been a bloody day between ſome of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Foot and Coll. <hi>Langſton</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe. The truth is, too many of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as well as <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> are highly oppreſſive to the poor Countrey; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Enemy have reduc'd themſelves to that order, that they exerciſe violence on none, but the Proprieties of ſuch as they know to be abſent, or, as they praſe it, in <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, whoſe Stock, Goods, and Eſtates are ſeized, and ſet by the Civil Government, and the proceed applied for and towards the charge of the War. And for their better direction in their ſeizures, it's reported and believed, that they have Copies of the particulars of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> loſſes, given in to the Committee of the late Houſe of Commons at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Enemies great work is to ſecure <hi>Dublin</hi> this Summer, they fearing an Attack before they could get Forrage for their Horſe; and willing to haſten that ſupply, they long ſince ordered all the Deer in the Parks of the <hi>Phoenix</hi> and <hi>Raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernham</hi> to be deſtroyed, and Cattel to be removed from <hi>Dublin</hi> to get the more earlier Graſs for their Horſe; of which by many Letters to Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> I gave that early notice, that I fear we may pay too dear for the delay; they have ſeized all the Arms and ſerviceable Horſes they can find within their reach, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> having their Religion and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Principle ſupported on the pretence of Law, and the Preſence of the King; and all ſo openly own'd by <hi>France,</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59238:116"/>makes them more united and unanimouſly reſolved than in any of their former Wars. Their Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> gives them too great help of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> hands; we have not a known <hi>Papiſt</hi> with us, they have hundreds of deluded <hi>Proteſtants</hi> with them. I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly told, that they have a ſmall Boat which they ſend weekly to <hi>Wales</hi> to fupply them with News from <hi>England;</hi> they ſpare for no charge to get Spies and Intelligence from our Quarters; they report they have daily Deſerters, and could have more, did they not preſume they may be more ſerviceable to them by continuing with us. They openly declare, that our Army conſiſts moſt of their Deſerters, and that it was ſucceſs made them leave them, and that the ſame motive will bring them back again. They told the number and the time of the <hi>Danes</hi> landing, and foretell that we ſhall ſoon repent their coming among us; they report that laying aſide the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> hands of this Countrey, and the other fore-mentioned Principles, were Arrows taken out of their Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; they tell us, that our King cannot be here till <hi>June,</hi> and that they ſhall be ready a month ſooner to receive him. They report his Army to be Thirty Thouſand, with vaſt ſtores of Arms and Ammunition and Proviſion; the <hi>London-derry</hi> and <hi>Eneskillen</hi> Forces with the recruits of this Countrey, are more dreadful to them than all our Foreign Forces. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on a defenſive War, and in caſe they have their promiſed ſupplies, they ſeem not to doubt but to keep <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> this Summer; their great difficulty is what to do with the great number of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> among them; they have many Propoſals under conſideration, but as yet they come to no reſolution. <hi>The King is much averſe to all Severity, yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſees he can make no impreſſion of Loyalty on them.</hi> The Enemy (as my Wife and Family which have got leave lately to come to me from <hi>Dublin</hi> tell me) report, with more confidence than, I hope, truth, that we have many <hi>Monks</hi> in our Army, many <hi>Sandwitches</hi> in our Fleet, and many <hi>Shaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sburys</hi> in our Council; and that they laid thoſe variety of Engines both in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that they ſeem not to doubt but that they ſhall have as many Invitations for their return to <hi>England</hi> in 1690. as they had in 1660. and that this Summer they ſhall be able to get Eighty Thouſand
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59238:117"/>Men into the Field, and find Money for their conſtant Pay.</p>
                  <p>Being ſo united as they are, and carrying on the War with ſo great concurrence of their Church, and having <hi>France</hi> for an additional ſupport, I do no ways wonder but that they may have as many Men; but how to procure them conſtant Pay, was ſomewhat my trouble to know. By their Eſtabliſhment I find, beſides Accoutrements and Hoſpital, that the Pay of a Foot Soldier is but 4 <hi>d.</hi> a Trooper as much over as a Dragoon is ſhort of <hi>12 <hi>d.</hi> per diem,</hi> ſo that Seventy Thouſand Foot will amount to 456000, <hi>l, per annum,</hi> and Ten Thouſand Horſe at 12 <hi>d. per diem,</hi> amounts to above 182000 <hi>l.</hi> making in the whole 638000, <hi>l.</hi> and if one fourth more is added for General Officers, Train of Artillary, Contingencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the whole amounts to 797000 <hi>l.</hi> How this ſum may be raiſed out of only three Provinces of this Countrey, ſeems to be the great doubt. By comparing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Accounts I have received from Spies, I find the heads of their Revenue to be as followeth:
<list>
                        <item>1. I find the late <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> granted their King a ſubſidy of 20000 <hi>l. per menſem,</hi> charged on Stock and Lands.</item>
                        <item>2. The Enemy finding us poſſeſs'd of one Province ſince the paſſing the Act, and finding much of the other three Provinces made waſte by their Order, and that by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent returns of their Braſs and Pewter Money, a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Trade is increaſed, they have by publick <hi>Proclamation</hi> ordered 20000 <hi>l.</hi> more to be aſſeſs'd on the Trading part of the Nation, according to their reſpective Trades, both which are preſum'd cannot yield leſs than 30000 <hi>l. per menſem de claro,</hi> which is <hi>per annum</hi> 360000 l.</item>
                        <item>3. They have bought on the King's Account all the Wool at <hi>6s. per Stone,</hi> Tallow at 15 <hi>l. per Tun,</hi> Beef Tallow, Hides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they intend to ſend for <hi>France</hi> to buy Arms and Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they eſteem may be worth at leaſt 200000 <hi>l.</hi> the Wool Licenſe at 4 <hi>d. per Stone</hi> to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport it only for <hi>England,</hi> was uſually worth to the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors 4 or 5000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. It is reported they have agreed with perſons who are obliged to Coin them this year 150000 <hi>l.</hi> Braſs and Pewter Money.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="13" facs="tcp:59238:117"/>5. The Rent of Church Lands and Abſentees Eſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Goods and Stocks, are eſtimated at leaſt to be 150000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> the truth of this will appear by the aforeſaid Books given in to the Committee of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. The King's ſtanding Revenue of Rents, Hearths, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-Exciſe, and caſual Revenue cannot be leſs than a 150000 <hi>l.</hi> more.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Memorandum,</hi> That all the aforeſaid particulars amount to 860000 <hi>l.</hi> out of which deduced the 797000 <hi>l.</hi> there will remain 73000 <hi>l.</hi> beſides what helps may be given him by <hi>France, &amp;c.</hi> and the addition that may be made by their Coining Braſs and Pewter Money above the aforeſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which Braſs and Pewter Coin being not fit to be kept, quickens returns and encreaſeth their Trade. By all which it appears, that the Enemy cannot want currant Coin to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the War: But had we Ships of War lying by in their Harbour to prevent their Exportations, and were <hi>Dublin</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, their Trade and Revenue would ſoon be leſſened. But if they are ſuffered to Export their vaſt quantity of Goods they have now ſtored up in their Ports, it may not only give a farther encreaſe to their Revenue, but occaſion a longer continuance of the War, eſpecially having made the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Army ſo low, and the currant value of their Braſs Coin ſo high. Their Braſs and Pewter Coin is of equal weight with our Silver Coin, which being uſually bought for 12 <hi>d. per pound,</hi> is of equal value with our Silver which is 3 <hi>l. per pound,</hi> and their eſtabliſhment being a moity ſhort of ours, 'tis demonſtrable, that ſix Penny worth of their Braſs or Pewter Money ſhall pay double as many Soldiers as 3 <hi>l.</hi> of our Silver Coin. What advantage this Money gives their Trade, what caſe in the pay of the Army and ſupplying them with Proviſion, is very demonſtrable; yet 'tis as ſtrange as true, that notwithſtanding they are better Paid, better Diſciplin'd than our Army, yet hitherto we may ſet up an <hi>Ebenezar,</hi> and ſay that God hath hitherto ſought for us, and that by the ſeeming worſe Diſcipline, worſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and worſe of our whole Army; I mean by our <hi>Eneskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and <hi>London-dery</hi> Forces, whoſe Moral and Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples you know are little better, but generally worſe than theirs, they having conſtantly beat their moſt choice and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59238:118"/>detached Parties, with a confuſed and diſordered Rabble, when they were not half the number of their Enemies; and have ſtruck them with that terror, that 'tis believed, notwithſtanding their great Number and Proviſion for their ſupport, the Enemy intends this Summer only a defenſive War, and to fight only by Detachments: But that which to me ſeems moſt ſtrange, yet is true, that notwithſtanding all the Violence, Oppreſſion and Wrong done by theſe and other of our Army on the Impoveriſhed, Oppreſſed and Plunder'd <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Inhabitants of this Province, and the little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and great diſcouragement they have had from us, yet you know, what I eſteem as a great preſage of future good, they continue and remain as firm and faithful to us, as the <hi>Iriſh Papists</hi> againſt us. How frequently do we hear them tell us, that though we continue to injure them, rob and deſtroy them, yet they muſt truſt in us, and be true and faithful to us!</p>
                  <p>We have juſt now Intelligence of the arrival of the <hi>French</hi> Succours, and vaſt ſtores of Arms and Proviſions. Oh, Sir! Where's our Fleet? Did they want early notice of their approach? What Lethargy attends them, and what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have had as ſecure paſſage from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> to <hi>France, Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> as if we had not one Man of War to hinder them, or ſecure us? If the <hi>French</hi> Fleet carry off as vaſt quantities of our Native Goods as they have brought in their Foreign Succors, <hi>Ichabod</hi> may be wrote on our future proceedings, it being believed by ſome, and confidently reported by others lately come from <hi>Dublin,</hi> that they were apprehending the chief <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in and about that City, to tranſport and make them Priſoners and Slaves of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>ON the 6th Inſtant I was introduced by my Lord <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> into my Lord Deputy's Preſence in the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> I have his <hi>Paſs</hi> to come and go through and back from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter;</hi> and though I have not his Excellency's direct Commiſſion, yet I will aſſure you I am at leaſt permitted by the Lord Deputy, to acquaint the Chief and others of thoſe of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter Aſſociation,</hi> with his Diſcourſe to me, which was to the effect following: <hi>to wit,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That his Excellency doth not delight in the Blood and Devaſtation of the ſaid Province; but however, highly reſents their taking, and continuing in Arms; the affronts done by them to his Majeſty's Government thereby, and by ſome Indignities done to the late <hi>Proclamation</hi> of <hi>Clemency,</hi> Iſſued and Dated —</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Notwithſtanding whereof, is willing to receive the ſaid Province into Protection, provided they immediately deliver up to his Army, for his Majeſty's uſe, their Arms and ſerviceable Horſes; and provided they deliver up to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency theſe three Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> — if they remain in the Kingdom, and may be had.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And for farther manifeſtation of his deſign to prevent Blood, is willing to grant ſafe Conduct even to the ſaid three Perſons or any other of their Party, to and from his Excellency, and to and from Leiutenant General <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Commander of part of his Army hereafter mentioned, if they intend any peaceable and reaſonable Treaty: But withall will not upon the ſaid account or any other, ſtop the march of the ſaid part of his Army, no not for one hour; and if it ſhall appear in ſuch Treaty, that they took up Arms meerly for Self-preſervation, then he will Pardon even the ſaid three Perſons alſo, but is hopeleſs that any ſuch thing can be made appear, ſeeing that many of them have already accepted and received Commiſſions from the Prince
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59238:119"/>of <hi>Orange,</hi> and diſplay his Colours in the field, as his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is credibly informed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If theſe terms be not immediately agreed to, he will with a part of his Army fight them, which part he intends ſhall be at <hi>Newry</hi> on <hi>Monday</hi> the 11th of this Inſtant, which will from thence march to <hi>Belfaſt,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Colrain,</hi> and <hi>London-derry,</hi> as his Excellency intends; and that the Countrey <hi>Iriſh</hi> not of the Army, Men, Women, and Boys, now all Armed with Half-Pikes and Bionets; in the Counties of <hi>Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, London-derry, &amp;c.</hi> will upon the approach of the ſaid part of the Army, and reſiſtance thereto made, immediately enter upon a Maſſacre of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> in the ſaid Counties; which force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Rabble, his Excellency ſaith he cannot reſtrain; and fears that it may be greater than in 1641. Theſe are the heads of what I can offer to you from his Excellency's own Mouth, but I intend to be at <hi>Hills-Borrough</hi> to night, and there to ſtay for this night, where, if you think fit, I ſhall freely diſcourſe with you all the particulars; whereof I hope, you will give immediate notice to all chiefly concerned in your County, and Neighbourhood, for gaining of time.

                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59238:122"/>and with a general diſperſion of all that did oppoſe us: We are now in ſo happy a proſpect of our Affairs, and of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the Rebellion of this Kingdom; that we hold it reaſonable to think of Mercy, and to have Compaſſion upon thoſe whom we judge to have been ſeduced. Wherefore we do hereby declare, we ſhall take into our Royal protection all poor Labourers, common Soldiers, Countrey Farmers, Plowmen, and Cottiers whatſoever; As alſo all Citizens, Townſmen, Tradeſmen, and Artificers, who either remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at home, or having fled from their dwelling, ſhall by the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next, repair to their uſual places of Aboad; ſurrendring up what Arms they have, to ſuch Juſtices of the Peace as are, or ſhall be appointed by us, not only to receive the ſame, but alſo to Regiſter the appearance of ſuch of the ſaid perſons as ſhall come and ſubmit unto our Authority. For our Royal intention is, and we do hereby declare, That we will not only pardon all thoſe poor ſeduced people, as to their Lives and Liberties, who ſhall come in by the time aforeſaid, for all Violences they have done or committed by the command of their Leaders, during the War: But we do alſo promiſe to ſecure them in their Goods, their Stocks of Cattel, and all their <hi>Chattels perſonal</hi> whatſoever; willing and requiring them to come in, and where they were Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, there to preſerve the Harveſt of Graſs and Corn for the ſupply of the Winter. But foraſmuch as many of them had a legal Right to the Tenancy of ſeveral Lands; ſome holden from Proteſtants, and ſome held from Popiſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors who have been concerned in the Rebellion againſt us: Our will and pleaſure is, That all thoſe Tenants who held from our good Proteſtant Subjects, do pay their Rents to their reſpective Landlords; and that the Tenants of all thoſe, who have been concerned in the preſent Rebellion againſt us, do keep their Rent in their hands, untill they have notice from the Commiſſioners of our Revenue unto whom they are to account for the ſame.

To the end therefore that all Perſons may be left without Excuſe, and by obedience to our Commands may prevent the <hi>fatal Conſequences</hi> of their Neglect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, We do hereby ſtrictly charge and require all Perſon and Perſons of the Popiſh Religion, within this our Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who are or reſide within our Quarters, or any part of our ſaid Kingdom reduced to our Obedience, that they, and every of them, do within ten days after publick Proclamation hereof in the City, or Shire-town of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein they reſpectively dwell or reſide, ſurrender and deliver all the Fire-arms, Swords, Bagonets, Skeins, Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes, and other arms offenſive or defenſive; as alſo all the Gun-powder which they lately had in their own Cuſtody, or in the Cuſtody of any other for their Uſe, to the next Mayor, chief Magiſtrate, Sheriff, or Juſtice of the Peace in the City, Town or County wherein they reſpectively dwell or inhabit; who are hereby required to regiſter the ſame, and to return a perfect Liſt of ſuch Arms and Ammunition as they ſhall receive by virtue hereof, to us, or the chief Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour or Governours of our ſaid Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> for the time being; as alſo to lodge the ſaid Arms and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our neareſt ſafe Gariſon to the place where they ſhall be received.

                     <p>WE are ſome of the Remains of the Clergy that have ventured to ſtay behind our Brethren in Perillous Times, and under great Diſcouragements, for the Diſcharge of our Duty to God and the People. Two of us are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who, together with Five more in the Kingdom, thought our ſelves obliged to continue here, to preſerve the Succeſſion of the Clergy, by the Ordination of Prieſts and Deacons, and the Seminary of the Church by Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The reſt of our Members are the Clergy of this City, and the Rural Clergy. The former of theſe have ſtaid upon their Charge, under great Wants and Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, having not only been deprived of all their Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but expoſed to daily Dangers, in and for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their Duties: And the latter are Perſons driven from their Cures, and forced to ſeek Relief and Sanctuary in this City.</p>
                     <p>We may poſſibly be cenſured by thoſe, who underſtand not the Grounds and Reaſons of our continuance in this Kingdom, as <hi>Trimmers,</hi> or Favourers of Popery: From the firſt we are able to acquit our ſelves, having been guilty of no Compliances, but ſuch as were the effects of Prudence and Self-preſervation, ſuch as were the effects of Prudence and Self-preſervation, ſuch as were at once both innocent and neceſſary, and fit to be obſerved to a Power, that was able to cruſh us far worſe than it did: And we are ſo far from being guilty of the latter, that we humbly conceive,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59238:126"/>That we could not more effectually oppoſe the growth and inundation of Popery, than by keeping up the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, by ſticking to our Flocks, and preventing their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries.</p>
                     <p>We do not come to crave your Majeſty's Protection for our Perſons, our Churches, our Religion, or our Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have been all in ſome meaſure invaded. Our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have been impriſon'd, our Churches taken from us, our Properties deſtroyed by a late Act of Parliament that took away our Tithes; and the free exerciſe of our Religion for ſome time interrupted. A Requeſt of this Nature might perhaps look like a diſtruſt of your Majeſty's care of us, and ſeem to contradict the Glorious deſign of your coming into this Kingdom. We have ſenſible that the generous End of your Majeſty's Preſence is to Reſcue us from the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Tyranny of Popery; and are well aſſured, that the ſame Paternal Affection, that moved your Majeſty to pity our diſtreſs, will ſtill protect us now we are delivered.</p>
                     <p>We come rather to bleſs God, as the Author of our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and Your Majeſty as the Happy Inſtrument raiſed up by his Providence for the effecting it; to expreſs our Gratitude and Duty to Your Majeſty, who has a double Title to our Services, not only as our King, but as our Gracious Benefactor and Deliverer: To pray for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of your Majeſty's Forces, for the Conſummation of that Good Work that you have with ſo much Perſonal Hazard undertaken, that you may carry your Victorious Arms in to other Countries, where the Cries, and the Groans, and the Oppreſſions of the Afflicted Proteſtants, are as great as they have been here: That God would be an Helmet of Salvation to you in the day of Battle, and deal with you as he did with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> when he promiſed him the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> for his hard Service againſt <hi>Tyrus:</hi> May he likewiſe recompenſe your hard Labour in this Kingdom, with the Addition of another that is far more valuable: And may you prove as Happy and Succeſsful an Inſtrument in the ſuccouring of others, as you have been of the poor Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted People of this Kingdom.</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59238:127"/>and of your Majeſty's extraordinary Care in preſerving the Walls of your Kingdom (the which your Ships and your Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have always been reputed to be) to the end that they may acquaint their Neighbours therewith.</p>
                  <p>It is known, Sir, that as for the Seamen, your Majeſty ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paid them with <hi>Tickets,</hi> and that you have paid the greateſt part of your Brother's Debts to them, and alſo to the Ship Wrights; and that the Seamen have been by your Majeſty punctually paid, as the Ships they belong to came home and were unrigg'd; and that the Workmen in the Yards are quarterly paid as ſoon as their Wages become due; and that the Cheſt at <hi>Chatham,</hi> out of which the maim'd Soldiers have been ſtill provided for, has been plentifully ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by your Majeſty out of your Own Purſe, to the value of about 20000 <hi>l.</hi> the Revenue of that Cheſt, by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections from the Seamen, having been ſo very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it did not near ſupport the Charge.</p>
                  <p>And I account, that ſince the laſt Parliament your Majeſty has laid out great Sums of Money in rebuilding and repairing the Thirty Sail, and the reſt of the Navy, and that to the value of 350000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Charge of your Majeſty's having ſince your Parliament built ſix new Men of War, will appear but comparatively inconſiderable, when it ſhall be thought of, how your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has ſince built new Store-Houſes at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> wherein Cables are ſorted and lye at length, and all manner of Sea Stores for Boat-Swains and Carpenters laid diſtinct for the reſpective Ships to which the ſame belong; as alſo their Rigging diſtinctly laid apart, which things were never done in <hi>England</hi> before; and by means whereof, your Ships may be Equipt for Sea in leſs than a quarter of the time that they were formerly. In the building of thoſe Store-Houſes, and furniſhing them with vaſt quantities of Stores, and all bought by your Majeſty with ready money, and at the beſt hand, I account your <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath expended Millions of Pounds Sterling.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gazetts</hi> that have in part made Publication of your <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s vaſt Charge in buying with ready money <hi>Maſts, Timber, Hemp, Sail-Cloth,</hi> and all other Naval Stores, have neceſſarily awakened the thoughts of your Subjects to reflect
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59238:128"/>with a high Veneration on your <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s having ſo freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for the publick uſe thoſe Supplies that were ſo freely afforded you in Parliament, (and without ſuch ſtrict Clauſes of appropriating them to particular uſes, as were in the laſt Reign,) and with joy to look on the glorious Super-ſtructure that your Reign hath hereby built on that great Foundation of the happineſs of any Kingdom, namely, an entire mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Confidence between Prince and People.</p>
                  <p>There is another thing occurs to my Obſervation; namely, That ſince your <hi>Parliament</hi> your <hi>Majeſty</hi> hath allowed for the yearly Charge of the <hi>Navy</hi> about 400000 <hi>l.</hi> which is much more than was allowed for that uſe in his late <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Reign.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are great things, Sir, and your Seamen cannot but be ſenſible, of the Honour and Happineſs you have taken care of for them, and how by your rebuilding your Capital Ships, you have prepared floating Pallaces for them to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and ſerve you in.</p>
                  <p>Sir, The Hearts of your Seamen having in them ſo great a conſtant ſtock of the natural heat of Loyalty, it is not to be wondered at, that this Noble Lord could by his Breath ſo eaſily occaſion that flame of Zeal for your <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Service, that has appeared in their <hi>Addreſs;</hi> his Lordſhip having likewiſe acquainted them with the tender regard your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> had to their wellfare and preſervation, and to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſed from all Grievances.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Sir, The things that I have before referred to, are ſuch as muſt naturally make great impreſſions, not only on your Seamen, but on all <hi>Engliſh Patriots,</hi> and incline your Subjects of all <hi>Religionary Perſuaſions,</hi> when they ſhall conſider how Indulgent and Provident a Father of their Countrey God hath ſet over them, to think of thoſe words, <hi>That he hath not dealt ſo with every Nation.</hi> And when they ſhall conſider thoſe great Effects of your Royal Care, for the ſecuring the Being of the Kingdom, and <hi>England's</hi> being a Kingdom for ever, to apply to your Self and to <hi>England,</hi> the great Landatory Expreſſion addreſt to King <hi>Solomon;</hi> namely, <hi>Becauſe God loved Iſrael for ever, therefore made he you King.</hi>

                  <p>I <hi>Thank you for your Addreſs, and I doubt not but when I ſhall think fit to call a Parliament, you will make it your buſineſs to chooſe ſuch good Men as ſhall correſpond with the effect of your Addreſs; I aſſure you, I never queſtioned the Loyalty of my Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I have my Self been an Eye Witneſs of both your Courage and your Loyalty, when I was your Admiral: And, Gentlemen, I am your Admiral ſtill, and my Seamen may depend upon it, that they ſhall always be well provided for and duly paid, and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully protected and encouraged by me, as much as the Seamen ever were by any of My Predeceſſors: Though ſome of My Neighbours give out, and would have it believed, that I have not the Hearts of My Seamen, yet I have found the contrary; for when I have occaſion to fit out any Ships, I do not find that I am in the leaſt want of Men; and whenever my Affairs may require the fitting out My whole Fleet, I do not in the leaſt doubt, but that I ſhall find My Seamen ready to ſerve Me.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though our Religion be eſtabliſh'd by Law, (which your Lordſhip urges as a Difference between our Caſe and that of the Primitive Chriſtians,) yet in the ſame Law which eſtabliſhes our Religion it is declared, <hi>That it is not Lawful upon any Pretence whatſoever to take up Arms,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, there is a particular Law, declaring the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> to be ſolely in the King: And that ties the Hands of Subjects, though the Law of Nature, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules of Scripture had left us at liberty; which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe they do not, becauſe the Government and Peace of Humane Society could not well ſubſiſt upon theſe Terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your Lordſhips Opinion is contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Doctrine of all Proteſtant Churches; and though ſome particular Perſons have taught otherwiſe; yet they have been contradicted herein, and condemned for it by the generality of Proteſtants. And I beg your Lordſhip to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how it will agree with an avowed aſſerting of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, to go contrary to the General Doctrine of Proteſtants. My end in this is to convince your Lordſhip that you are in a very great and dangerous miſtake, and being ſo convinced, that which before was a Sin of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, will appear of much more heinous Nature, as in Truth it is, and call for a very particular and deep repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; which if your Lorſhip ſincerely exerciſe upon the ſight of your Error, by a penitent acknowledgement of it to God and Men, you will not only obtain forgiveneſs of God, but prevent a mighty Scandal to the Reformed Religion. I am very loath to give your Lordſhip any diſquiet in the diſtreſs you are in, which I commiſerate from my Heart; but am much more concerned, that you do not leave the World in a deluſion, and falſe Peace, to the hindrance of your Eternal Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>I heartily pray for you, and beſeech your Ldſhip to believe that I am, with the greateſt ſincerity and compaſſion in the World,</p>

                  <head>Licenſed and Entred; <hi>March</hi> 23. 1689.</head>
                  <p>TO comply with what you deſire, I will explain ſome things which we talked of before I left <hi>England.</hi> I have been in a <hi>Station</hi> of great Noiſe, without Power or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage whilſt I was in it, and to my <hi>Ruine</hi> now I am out of it. I know I cannot juſtifie my ſelf by ſaying, though it is true, that I thought to have prevented much miſchief; for when I found that I could not, I ought to have quitted the ſervice. Neither is it an <hi>Excuſe</hi> that I have got none of thoſe things which uſually engage men in publick Affairs; my Quality is ſtill the ſame it ever was, and my Eſtate much worſe, even ruined, though I was born to a very conſiderable one, which I am aſhamed to have ſpoiled, though not ſo much as if I had encreaſed it by indirect means. But to go on to what you expect: The <hi>pretence</hi> to a <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> being not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt thing which was much diſliked ſince the Death of the late King, but the foundation of all the reſt, I ought to begin with that, which I had ſo little to doe with, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard it ſpoken of till the time of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebellion, that the King told ſome of the Council, of which I was one, that he was reſolved to give Employments to <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> it being fit that all Perſons ſhould ſerve who could be uſefull, and on whom he might depend. I think every body adviſed him againſt it, but with little effect, as was ſoon ſeen: That <hi>Party</hi> was ſo pleaſed with what the King had done, that they <hi>perſuaded</hi> him to mention it in his <hi>Speech</hi> at the next meeting of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which he did, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Debates whether it was <hi>proper</hi> or not; in all which I <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> it, as is known to very conſiderable Perſons, ſome of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59238:133"/>which were of another opinion; for I thought it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the King too far, and it did give ſuch Offence to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that it was thought neceſſary to <hi>prorogue</hi> it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the King fell immediately to the <hi>ſupporting</hi> the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Power,</hi> the moſt Chimerical Thing that was ever thought of, and muſt be ſo, till the Government here is as abſolute as in <hi>Turkey,</hi> all Power being included in that one. This is the ſenſe I ever had of it, and when I heard Lawyers defend it, I never changed my <hi>Opinion</hi> or <hi>Language:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it went on, moſt of the Judges being for it, and was the chief Buſineſs of the State, till it was looked on as ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled. Then the Eccleſiaſtical Court was ſet up, in which there being ſo many conſiderable Men of ſeveral kinds, I could have but a ſmall part; and that after Lawyers had told the King it was legal, and nothing like the <hi>High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Court,</hi> I can moſt truly ſay, and it is well known, that for a good while I defended <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, purely by Care and Induſtry, and have hundreds of times begg'd of the King never to grant <hi>Mandates,</hi> or to change any thing in the <hi>regular courſe</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> which he often thought reaſonable, and then by perpetual importunities was prevailed upon <hi>againſt his own Senſe,</hi> which was the very Caſe of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, as of ſome others.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things which I endeavoured, though without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, drew upon me the Anger and ill Will of many about the King. The next thing to be tried, was to take off the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> and the <hi>Teſts,</hi> ſo many having promiſed their Concurrence towards it, that his Majeſty thought it fecible; but he ſoon found it was not to be done by that Parliament, which made all the Catholicks deſire it might be diſſolved, which I was ſo much againſt, that they complained of me to the King, as a Man who ruined all his Deſigns by <hi>oppoſing</hi> the <hi>only thing</hi> could carry him on, Liberty of <hi>Conſcience</hi> being the Foundation on which he was to build. That it was firſt offered at by the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> who by it had done the work, even in the <hi>late King's Time,</hi> if it had not been for his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Weakneſs of his Miniſters: Yet I hindred the Diſſolution ſeveral Weeks, by telling the King, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in Being would doe every thing he could deſire, but the taking off the Penal Laws and the Teſts, or the allowing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59238:133"/>his Diſpenſing Power; and that any other Parliament, tho' ſuch a one could be had as was propoſed, would probably never repeal thoſe Laws; and if they did, they would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never do any thing for the ſupport of the Government, whatever Exigency it might be in. At that time the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſick, upon which I ſaid often to the King, that if he ſhould dye, it would be impoſſible for his Majeſty to preſerve the Peace of Chriſtendom; that a War muſt be expected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch a one as would chiefly concern <hi>England;</hi> that if the preſent Parliament continued, he might be ſure of all the Help and Service he could wiſh; but in caſe he diſſolved it, he muſt give over all thoughts of foreign Affairs, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would ever aſſiſt him, but on ſuch terms as would ruine the Monarchy; ſo that from abroad, or at home, he would be deſtroyed, if the Parliament were broken, and any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhould happen, of which there were many, to make the Aid of his People neceſſary to him. This and much more I ſaid to him ſeveral times privately, and in the hearing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but being over-powered, the Parliament was broke, the Cloſeting went on, and a new one was to be choſen. Who was to get by Cloſeting I need not ſay; but it was certainly not I, nor any of my Friends: many of them ſuffered, who I would fain have ſaved: And yet I muſt confeſs with Grief, that when the King was reſolved, and there was no remedy, I did not quit as I ought to have done; but ſerved on in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the calling another Parliament. In the midſt of all the preparations for it, and whilſt the Corporations were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating, the King thought fit to order his Declarations to be read in all Churches, of which I moſt ſolemnly proteſt I never heard one word, till the King directed it in Council: That drew on the Petition of my Lord the Arch Bp. of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and the other Lords the Biſhops, and the Proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I was ſo openly againſt, that by arguing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to ſhew the Injuſtice and Imprudence of it, I brought the Fury of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> upon me to ſuch a degree, and ſo unanimouſly, that I was juſt ſinking; and I wiſh I had then ſunk: But whatever I did fooliſhly to preſerve my ſelf, I continued ſtill to be the object of their Hatred, and I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſerve the Publick as well as I could, which I am ſure
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59238:134"/>moſt of the conſiderable Proteſtants then at Court can teſtifie, and ſo can one very eminent Man in the Country, whom I would have perſuaded to come into buſineſs, which he might have done, to have helped me to reſiſt the Violence of thoſe in power; but he deſpaired of being able to doe any good, and therefore would not engage. Some time after came the firſt News of the Prince's Deſigns, which were not then look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on as they have proved, no body foreſeeing the Miracles he has done by his wonderful Prudence, Conduct, and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; for the greateſt thing which has been undertaken theſe thouſand years, or perhaps ever, could not be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vertues hardly to be imagined till ſeen nearer hand. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt thoughts of his coming I laid hold of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to preſs the King to doe ſeveral things which I would have had done ſooner, the chief of which were to reſtore <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, and all other Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, which had been diverted from what they were intended for, to take off my Lord Bp. of <hi>London</hi>'s Suſpenſion, to put the Counties into the ſame hands they were in ſome time before, to annull the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and to reſtore entirely all the Corporations of <hi>England:</hi> Theſe things were done effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, by the help of ſome about the King, and it was then thought I had deſtroyed my ſelf by enraging again the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick party to ſuch a height as had not been ſeen; they diſperſed Libels of me every day, told the King that I betraid him, that I ruined him by perſuading him to make ſuch ſhamefull Condeſcentions; but moſt of all by hindring the ſecuring the chief of the diſaffected Nobility and Gentry, which was propoſed as a certain way to break all the Prince's Meaſures; and by adviſing his Majeſty to call a free Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to depend upon that, rather than upon foreign Aſſiſtence. It is true I did give him thoſe Counſels which were called weak, to the laſt moment he ſuffered me in his Service; then I was accuſed of holding a Correſpondence with the <hi>Prince,</hi> and it was every where ſaid amongſt them, that no better could be expected from a Man ſo allied to Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Halifax.</hi> After this Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of High Treaſon were brought againſt me, which, with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59238:134"/>ſome other reaſons relating to affairs abroad, drew the King's diſpleaſure upon me, ſo as to turn me out of all without any Conſideration; and yet I thought I eſcaped well, expecting nothing leſs than the loſs of my Head, as my Lord <hi>Middleton</hi> can tell, and I believe none about the Court thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; nor had it been otherwiſe, if my Diſgrace had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a day longer: All things being prepared for it, I was put out the 27th of <hi>October,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks having been two Months working the King up to it without intermiſſion, beſides the ſeveral Attacks they had made upon me before, and the unuſual aſsiſtence they obtained to do what they thought ſo neceſſary for the carrying on their Affairs, of which they never had greater hope than at that time, as may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by any who were then at <hi>London.</hi> But you deſired that I would ſay ſomething to you of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I will do in very few words, but exactly true.</p>
                  <p>My Lord <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> has been ſo abſolute there, that I never had the Credit to make an Enſign, or keep one in, nor to preſerve ſome of my Friends, for whom I was much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, from the leaſt Oppreſsion and Injuſtice, though I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured it to the utmoſt of my power; but yet with care and diligence, being upon the place, and he abſent, I diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the calling a Parliament there, which was deſigned to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar the Acts of Settlement. Chief Juſtice <hi>Nugent</hi> and Baron <hi>Rice</hi> were ſent over with a draught of an Act for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, furniſhed with all the preſsing Arguments could be thought on to perſuade the King, and I was offered forty thouſand pound for my Concurrence, which I told the King, and ſhewed him at the ſame time the injuſtice of what was propoſed to him, and the prejudice it would be to that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, with ſo good Succeſs, that he reſolved not to think of it that year, and perhaps never. This I was helped in by ſome Friends, particularly my Lord <hi>Godolphin,</hi> who knows it to be true, and ſo do the Judges before named, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others.</p>
                  <p>I cannot omit ſaying ſomething of <hi>France,</hi> there having been ſo much talk of a <hi>League</hi> between the two Kings. I do proteſt I never knew of any; and if there were ſuch a thing, it was carried on by other ſort of men laſt Summer. Indeed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59238:135"/>
                     <hi>French</hi> Ships were offered to join with our Fleet, and they were refuſed: Since the noiſe of the Prince's Deſign more Ships were offered, and it was agreed how they ſhould be commanded; if ever deſired. I oppoſed to death the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, as well as any Aſſiſtence of Men, and can ſay moſt truly, that I was the principal means of hindering both, by the help of ſome Lords, with whom conſulted every day, and they with me, to prevent what we thought would be of great Prejudice, if not ruinous to the Nation. If the Report is true, of Men, Ships, and Money, intended lately for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> it was agreed upon ſince I was out of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or without my knowledge; if it had been otherwiſe, I believe no Body thinks my Diſgrace would have happened. My greateſt misfortune has been to be thought the Promoter of thoſe things I oppoſed and deteſted, whilſt ſome I could name have been the <hi>Inventors</hi> and <hi>Contrivers</hi> of what they have had the art to lay upon others; and <hi>I</hi> was often fooliſhly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bear what my Maſter would have done, though <hi>I</hi> uſed all poſsible Endeavors againſt it. <hi>I</hi> lie under many other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes and Afflictions extreme heavy; but <hi>I</hi> hope they have brought me to reflect on the occaſion of them, the looſe, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and unthinking Life <hi>I</hi> have hitherto led, having been perpetually hurried away from all good Thoughts by Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> the <hi>Vanity of the Court,</hi> or by <hi>Buſineſs: I</hi> hope, <hi>I</hi> ſay, that <hi>I</hi> ſhall overcome all the Diſorders my former Life had brought upon me, and that <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpend the remaining part of it in begging of Almighty God that he will pleaſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put an end to my Sufferings, or to give me ſtrength to bear them, one of which he will certainly grant to ſuch as relie on him, which <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> do, with the ſubmiſsion that becomes a good Chriſtian. I would enlarge on this Subject, but that I fear you might think ſomething elſe to be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, beſides a true ſenſe of my Faults, and that obliges me to reſtrain my ſelf at preſent. I believe you will repent in having engaged me to give you this Account, but I cannot the doing what you deſire of me.</p>

Yet it ſo happened: (for Reaſons not proper to be here inſerted,) that this Expedient fell ſhort of giving a general Satisfaction, People ſtill continuing (or at leaſt pretending to be) divided in their Judgments about this Matter: And ſince your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon Application, are pleaſed to condeſcend to Buſineſs, though of an inferiour nature; it's therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceived, that a farther Examination into the Birth of the ſaid Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> will not be unacceptable to your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially if your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall pleaſe to conſider the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Prince of <hi>Orange, Octob.</hi> 10. 1688. has avowed himſelf diſſatisfied about the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to that Degree, that his Highneſs has declared, <hi>The want of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Evidence in this point one principal Motive of his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into</hi> England; <hi>and likewiſe engaged himſelf to refer the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into this Affair, and of all things relating to it, to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Parliament.</hi> Decl. p. 12, 13.</item>

                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:59238:136"/>2. The King, in his Majeſty's Letter to the Convention, dated at St. <hi>Germains, Jan.</hi> 1688. conjures the Lords, and the Gentlemen then met, to <hi>make a thorough Examination into the Birth of the Prince of</hi> Wales. Now ſince both Parties are ſo preſſing to have this Matter debated, by a publick Tryall; ſince their Honour and Inclinations are ſo far engaged for the clearing this Point, it's humbly hoped your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after almoſt two years delay, may not think it improper to have it undertaken.</item>
                     <item>3. It's preſumed your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how deeply the Deponents to this Affair have been cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both in Pamphlets and common Diſcourſe; as if they were Confederates to an Impoſture of the moſt flagitious and provoking nature, and contrived to impoſe an Heir upon theſe Kingdoms; a Maſterpiece of Wickedneſs which as in their Souls they abhor, ſo they think it their great Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to lie under the Scandal of ſo heavy an Imputation: And therefore it's the humble Deſire of ſeveral of the ſaid Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, (not doubting of the Concurrence of the reſt,) that the Caſe may be re examined, and the Witneſſes ſummoned, before your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that ſo they may either have opportunity to reſcue their Honour and Reputation. (which they value above all worldly Bleſſings) from thoſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are caſt upon them; or, upon Conviction of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity, may undergo the Penalties due to ſo vile and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exempled a Perjury. And that your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be the more inclinable to hear them in Vindication of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeveral of the ſaid Deponents do promiſe, That their next Teſtimony ſhall be, if poſſible, more plain, particular, and comprehenſive than the former; and that they have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things to offer to your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not unworthy of your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Knowledge, which before were judged unneceſſary, and omitted out of Modeſty and Reſerve.</item>
                     <item>4. For a farther Motive, your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may pleaſe to take notice, That Circumſtances of Time are now ſuch, that it cannot with the leaſt pretence of Reaſon be ſuppoſed that the Deponents are either bribed or overawed into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Teſtimony, in ſavour of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore objected againſt them by the <hi>Proteſtant Memorial,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59238:136"/>the <hi>Full Anſwer to the Depoſitions,</hi> &amp;c. Beſides, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> know, the preſent Poſture of Affairs will afford all imaginable Encouragement for Freedom of Queſtions, for confronting the Deponents, and producing Counter-Evidences, (if there is any ſuch;) ſo that the whole Matter may be laid open, and cleared, to the ſatisfaction of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned therein.</item>
                     <item>5. With all due Submiſſion to your Lordſhips Judgments, it's humbly conceived, That Diſpatch and Expedition in this Caſe is a very valuable Circumſtance: For by this means your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will prevent thoſe Inconveniencies which may happen from Accidents, and Mortality. For notwithſtanding the Evidence is enrolled in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and may be inſpected at any time hereafter; yet if the number of the Deponents ſhould be leſſened, your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot enter upon the Merits of the Cauſe with the ſame Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, nor receive that Satisfaction <hi>viva Voce</hi> which may be now had: Beſides, there is reaſon to apprehend it will be too late to exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pt againſt the Teſtimony of the Deponents after their Deceaſe; ſo that if there have been any unfair Dealing, the Opportunity of Diſcovering it will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being loſt.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Laſtly, Your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may pleaſe to conſider, Whether in caſe the Depoſitions are neither diſproved, nor the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> owned, the Conſequence of ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure may not prove unfortunate? For ſince in ſtrictneſs of Law there is no greater Proof required for the Legitimacy of a King's Son, than for that of an inferiour Subject, it's to be feared ſome ill-diſpoſed and litigious Perſons will take occaſion from hence to queſtion the Birth of private Perſons, which poſſibly they will be apt to ſay is ſeldom ſo well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted as that of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> Which malitious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, how far they may tend to the creating Diſputes, entangling Property, and the diſhonour of Families, as your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the beſt Judges, ſo your Quality and Fortunes make it more particularly your Lordſhips Intereſt to prevent.</p>
                  <p>There remains no more to trouble your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with, excepting this humble Requeſt, That provided your
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59238:137"/>Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall think it proper to wave making any farther Enquiry into this Affair, an Expedient may be found out to cover the Deponents from the Aſperſion of Falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and that the Nation may have leave to believe your Lordſhips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are fully ſatisfied with their <hi>former Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>

                  <head>A true Copy of Part of that Paper which Mr. <hi>Aſhton</hi> left in a Friend's Hands: Together with the Letter in which he ſent it encloſed.</head>
                  <p>[The Paper begins with the Speech already publiſhed, immediately after which he adds,]</p>
                  <p>THus much is contained in the Paper that I deſign to leave with the Sheriff.</p>
                  <p>But being ſuddenly to give up my Accounts to the Searcher of all Hearts, I think it a duty incumbent upon me to impart ſome things farther, which neither the Intereſt nor Iniquity of theſe Times will, I conclude, willingly bear the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, and therefore not fit to be inſerted in the Sheriffs Paper.</p>
                  <p>Some time after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Arrival here, when it was expected, that, purſuant to his own Declaration, and the King's Letter to the Convention, an exact Search and Enquiry would have been made into the Birth of the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> there was a Scheme drawn up of that whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the Proofs that were then (and are ſtill) ready to be produced, to prove his Royal Highneſs's Legitimacy; but no publick Examination being ever had, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Times, as well as Intereſt of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not permitting any private Perſon to move in it, thoſe Papers have ever ſince lain by: But it being now thought adviſable by ſome, to have them printed and publiſhed, and (as at firſt they were deſigned) addreſſed at their next Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lords and Commons, entreating them to enquire
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59238:137"/>into that weighty Affair, and call forth, examine, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect for who elſe dares to appear) the many Witneſſes to the ſeveral particulars therein offered to be legally proved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was ordered to carry thoſe Papers to the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for his View, that his Leave and Approbation might go along with the Deſires of his good Subjects here; and they being taken with me, with ſome other Papers of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a ſmall Trunck, amongſt my Linen, and other private things of my own, and not in the Packet, (my Ld. <hi>Preſton</hi> being altogether a ſtranger to the whole Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,) by this means fell into the hands of our preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; who though they wiſely waved the producing them as Evidence at my Tryall, yet have I juſt reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my greateſt Crimes were contained in them; and I do therefore conclude and hope, that I onely am deſigned to be ſacrificed, who onely knew of them: Nor am I ſurpriſed at it, ſince nothing, I think, can be more prejudicial to ſome Perſons preſent Intereſt, than the expoſing of thoſe Papers to the Publick, which will ſet that pretended Myſtery of Darkneſs in ſo clear a Light, that all Mankind muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his Highneſs's being born of the Queen, and of their Wickedneſs who have malitiouſly and deſignedly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that innocent Prince to be an Impoſtor. The Love and Compaſſion that I have for my native Countrey, as well as Charity obliges me humbly to implore Almighty God to be mercifull to it, and not to charge this great Sin to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Account, and that we may not farther provoke his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice by our wilfully continuing in Errour and miſtake, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to put it into the Hearts of the Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at their next Meeting, to examine into that whole Matter, and (if before that time this be publiſhed) to enquire after, call for, and, if poſſible, retrieve thoſe Papers that were taken with me; whereby the Obſtinate will moſt certainly be convinc'd, the Ignorant informed, the Doubtfull confirmed, the Eyes of all opened, and a ſacred, moſt important Truth made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the whole World. —</p>

                  <p>KNowing your Friendſhip and Fidelity, to your, and yours onely, as unto ſafe and ſecure (though diſtant) Hands, I recommend the encloſed Papers. What chiefly relates to my ſelf, being the firſt part. I deſign to leave with the Sheriff; nor ſhall I be anxious about his diſpoſal of it: But the following paragraphs, that concern the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and — I beg you to preſerve as Jewels, and publiſh them, either part, or all, (chiefly that about the Prince,) whenever time or occaſion ſeems to require. And as to the fitneſs of either, you may be pleaſed to conſult <hi>A. B.</hi>'s Advice; I doubt not but ſooner or later they will all be uſefull: and that you may the more value them, I do moſt ſolemnly proteſt, I have been as carefull in what I have aſſerted for truth, as if I were now at God's dreadfull Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, where I expect ſuddenly to appear, and by his Mercy hope to hear that raviſhing Sound, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>What relates to Mr. <hi>Elliot,</hi> though I deſign to declare as much to ſome, who at his Tryall may give it in Evidence, yet I thought it juſt to leave a Record of his Innocency under my Hand.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing to add, but to requeſt your Prayers, That God of his infinite Mercy would ſupport and ſtrengthen me in my laſt Moments, and take to himſelf,</p>

                     <hi>Mac-jan Mac-donald,</hi> Laird of <hi>Glenco,</hi> a Branch of the <hi>Mackdonalds,</hi> one of the greateſt Clans (or Tribes) in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> came with the moſt conſiderable Men of his Clan to Collonel <hi>Hill,</hi> Governour of <hi>Fort-William</hi> at <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlochy,</hi> ſome few days before the expiring of the time for receiving the Indemnity appointed by Proclamation, which, as I take it, was the 1ſt of <hi>January</hi> laſt, entreating he would adminiſter to him the Oaths which the foreſaid Proclamation required to be taken; that ſo ſubmitting himſelf to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he might have its Protection. The Collonel receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with all Expreſſions of Kindneſs; nevertheleſs ſhifted the adminiſtring the Oaths to him, alledging, that by the Proclamation it did not belong to him, but to the Sheriffs, Bailives of Regalities, and Magiſtrates of Burghs, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter them. <hi>Mac-jan</hi> complaining that by this Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he might be wronged, the time being now near the expiring, and the Weather ſo extreme, and the ways ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad, that it was not poſſible for him ſo ſoon to reach any Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> got from Collonel <hi>Hill,</hi> under his Hand, his Protection; and withall he was aſſured, that no Orders from the Government againſt him ſhould be put in Execution, untill he were firſt advertiſed, and had time allowed him to apply himſelf to King or Council for his own Safety. But the better to make all ſure, (though this might have ſeemed Security enough for that time,) with all diſpatch imaginable he poſted to <hi>Inverary,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Argileſhire,</hi> there he found Sir <hi>Colin Camphell</hi> of <hi>Ardkinlis,</hi> Sheriff of that Shire, and craved of him the benefit of the Indemnity, according to the Proclamation, he being willing to perform all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

Sir <hi>Colin</hi> at firſt ſcrupled to admit him to the Oaths, the time which the Proclamation did appoint being elapſed by one day, alledging it would be of no uſe to him then to take them: But <hi>Mac-jan</hi> repreſented that it was not his fault, he having come in time enough to Collonel <hi>Hill,</hi> not doubting but he could have adminiſtred the Oaths to him, and that upon his refuſal he had made ſuch haſte to <hi>Inverary,</hi> that he might have come in time enough, had not the extremity of the Weather hindred him; and even as it was, he was but one day after the time appointed, and that would be very unbecoming the Government to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a Man's coming late by one day, eſpecially when he had done his utmoſt to have come in time. Upon this, and his threatening to proteſt againſt the Sheriff for the ſeverity of this Uſage, he adminiſtred to him and his Attendants the Oaths, <hi>Mac-jan</hi> depending upon the Indemnity granted to thoſe who ſhould take them; and having ſo done, he went home, and lived quietly and peaceably under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till the day of his Death.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>January</hi> laſt a Party of the Earl of <hi>Argile</hi>'s Regiment came to that Countrey, the deſign of their coming was then ſuſpected to be to take courſe with thoſe who ſhould ſtand out, and not ſubmit, and take the Oaths. The Gariſon of <hi>Inverlochy</hi> being thronged, and <hi>Glenco</hi> being commodious for quartering, as being near that Gariſon, thoſe Soldiers were ſent thither to quarter; they pretended they came to exact Arrears of Ceſs and Hearth-money, (a Tax never known in <hi>Scotland,</hi> until laid on by the Parliament 1690. after the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> had eaſed themſelves of it;) e'er they entred <hi>Glenco</hi> that Laird, or his Sons, came out to meet them, and asked them if they came as Friends, or as Enemies: The Officers anſwered, as Friends; and gave their Parol of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that they would neither do him nor his Concerns any Harm; upon which he welcomed them, promiſing them the beſt Entertainment the place could afford. This he really performed, as all the Soldiers confeſs. He and they lived together in mutual Kindneſs and Friendſhip fifteen days, or thereabout; ſo far was he from fearing any hurt from them. And the very laſt day of his Life he ſpent in keeping Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the Commander of that Party, Capt. <hi>Campbell</hi> of

Some time that very day, but whether before or after their parting, I know not, Capt. <hi>Campbel</hi> had theſe Orders ſent him from Major <hi>Duncanſon,</hi> a Copy whereof I here ſend you.</p>

                  <p>The Soldiers being diſpoſed five or three in a Houſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the Family they were to aſſaſſinate, had their order given them ſecretly. They had been all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as Friends by thoſe poor People, who intending no Evil themſelves, little ſuſpected that their Gueſts were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be their Murtherers. At 5 a Clock in the morning they began their bloody Work, ſurpriſed and butchered 38 perſons, who had kindly received them under their roofs. <hi>Mac jan</hi> himſelf was murthered, and is much bemoaned; he was a ſtately well favoured Man, and of good Courage and Senſe: As alſo the Laird of <hi>Archintrikin,</hi> a Gentleman of more than ordinary Judgment and Underſtanding, who had ſubmitted to the Government, and had Collonel <hi>Hill</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in his pocket, which he had got three Months before. I cannot without horrour repreſent how that a Boy about eight Years of Age was murthered; he feeing what was done to others in the Houſe with him, in a terrible Fright run out of the Houſe, and eſpying Capt. <hi>Campbell,</hi> graſped him about the Legs, crying for Mercy, and offering to be his Servant all his Life. I am informed Capt. <hi>Campbell</hi> inclined to ſpare
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59238:142"/>him, but one <hi>Drummond,</hi> an Officer, barbarouſly run his Dagger through him, whereof he dyed immediately. The rehearſal of ſeveral particulars and circumſtances of this tragical Story, makes it appear moſt dolefull, as that <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> was killed as he was drawing on his Breeches, ſtanding before his Bed, and giving orders to his Servants for the good Entertainment of thoſe who murthered him; while he was ſpeaking the words, he was ſhot through the Head, and fell dead in his Ladies Arms, who through the grief of this, and other bad uſages ſhe met with, dyed the next day. It is not to be omitted, that moſt of thoſe poor People were killed when they were aſleep, and none was allowed to pray to God for Mercy. Providence ordered it ſo, that that Night was moſt boiſterous; ſo as a party of 400 Men, who ſhould have come to the other end of the <hi>Glen,</hi> and begun the like Work there at the ſame hour, (intending that the poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſhould be encloſed, and none of them eſcape,) could not march that length, untill it was nine a Clock, and this afforded to many an happy opportunity of eſcaping, and none were killed but thoſe in whoſe Houſes <hi>Campbell</hi> of <hi>Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyon</hi>'s Men were quartered, otherwiſe all the Males under 70 Years of Age, to the number of 200, had been cut off, for that was the order; and it might have eaſily been executed, eſpecially conſidering that the Inhabitants had no Arms at that time; for upon the firſt hearing that the Soldiers were coming to the <hi>Glen,</hi> they had conveyed them all out of the way: For though they relied on the Promiſes which were made them for their Safety; yet they thought it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they might be diſarmed. I know not whether to impute it to difficulty of diſtinguiſhing the difference of a few Years, or to the Fury of the Soldiers, who being once glutted with Blood, ſtand at nothing, that even ſome above ſeventy years of Age were deſtroyed. They ſet all the Houſes on Fire, drove off all the Cattel to the Gariſon of <hi>Inverlochy, viz.</hi> 900 Cows, 200 Horſes, and a great many Sheep and Goats, and there they were divided among the Officers. And how diſmal may you imagine the Caſe of the poor Women and Children was then! It was lamentable, paſt Expreſſion; their Husbands, and Fathers, and neareſt Relations were forced to flee for their Lives; they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59238:142"/>almoſt ſtript, and nothing left them, and their Houſes being burnt, and not one Houſe nearer than ſix miles; and to get thither they were to paſs over Mountains, and wreaths of Snow, in a vehement Storm, wherein the greateſt part of them periſhed through Hunger and Cold. It fills me with Horror to think of poor ſtript Children, and Women, ſome with Child, and ſome giving Suck, wreſtling againſt a Storm in Mountains, and heaps of Snow, and at length to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and give over, and fall down, and dye miſerably. You ſee in <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Order to <hi>Duncanſon,</hi> there's a ſpecial Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>that the old Fox, nor none of his Cubs ſhould eſcape;</hi> and in <hi>Duncanſon</hi>'s Order to Captain <hi>Campbell</hi> of <hi>Glenlyon, that the old Fox, nor none of his Sons eſcape;</hi> but notwithſtanding all this wicked Caution, it pleaſed God that the two young Gentlement <hi>Mac jan</hi>'s Sons eſcaped: For it happened that the younger of theſe Gentlemen truſted little to the fair Promiſes of <hi>Campbell,</hi> and had a more watchfull Eye over him than his Father or Brother, who ſuffered themſelves by his reiterated Oaths to be deluded into a Belief of his Integrity: He having a ſtrong Impreſſion on his Spirit, that ſome miſchievous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was hidden under <hi>Campbell</hi>'s ſpecious Pretences, it made him, after the reſt were in Bed, remain in a retired Corner, where he had an advantagious proſpect into their Guard. About midnight perceiving ſeveral Soldiers to enter it, this encreaſed his Jealouſie; ſo he went and communicated his Fears to his Brother, who could not for a long time be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded there was any bad Deſign againſt them, and aſſerted, that what he had ſeen was not a doubling of their Guards in order to any ill deſign, but that being in a ſtrange place, and at a diſtance from the Garriſon, they were to ſend out Sentinels far from the Guard, and becauſe of the Extremity of the Weather relieved them often, and that the Men he ſaw could be no more but theſe. Yet he perſiſting to ſay, that they were not ſo ſecure, but that it was fit to acquaint their Father with what he had ſeen, he prevailed with his Brother to riſe, and go with him to his Father, who lay in a room contiguous to that they were in. Though what the younger Son alledged made no great Impreſſion on his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet he allowed his Sons to try what they could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. They well knowing all skulking places there, went and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59238:143"/>hid themſelves near to a Centinel's Poſt, where inſtead of one they diſcovered eight or ten Men; this made them more inquiſitive, ſo they crept as near as they could without being diſcovered, ſo near that they could hear one ſay to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>he liked not this Work, and that had he known of it he would have been very unwilling to have come there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that none, except their Commanders, knew of it till within a quarter of an hour.</hi> The Soldier added, that he was willing to fight againſt the Men of the <hi>Glen,</hi> but it was baſe to murder them. But to all this it was anſwered, <hi>All the blame be on ſuch as gave the Orders; we are free, being bound to obey our Officers.</hi> Upon hearing of theſe words the young Gentlemen retired as quickly and quietly as they could towards the Houſe, to inform their Father of what they had heard; but as they came nigh to it they perceived it ſurrounded, and heard Guns diſcharged, and People ſhrieking; whereupon, being unarm'd, and totally unable to reſcue their Father, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their own Lives in hopes yet to ſerve their King and Countrey, and ſee Juſtice done upon thoſe Hell-hound, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Murtherers, the Shame of their Countrey, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not forget to tell you, that there were two of theſe Officers who had given their Paroll of Honour to <hi>Mac-jan,</hi> who refuſed to be concerned in that brutal Tragedy, for which they were ſent Priſoners to <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> where if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main not ſtill, I am ſure they were ſome Weeks ago.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Sir, in obedience to your Commands I have ſent you ſuch account as I could get of that monſtrous and moſt inhumane Maſſacre of the Laird of <hi>Glenco,</hi> and others of his <hi>Clan.</hi> You deſire ſome Proofs for the Truth of the Story<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s for you ſay there are many in <hi>England</hi> who cannot believe ſuch a thing could be done, and publick Juſtice not executed upon the Ruſſians: For they take it for granted, that no ſuch Order could be given by the Government; and you ſay they will never believe it without a downright Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Sir, As to the Government I will not meddle with it, or whether theſe Officers who murdered <hi>Glenco,</hi> had ſuch Orders as they pretended from the Government; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment knows that beſt, and how to vindicate their own
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59238:143"/>Honour, and puniſh the Murtherers who pretended their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſtill ſtand upon it. But as to the Matter of Fact of the Murther of <hi>Glenco,</hi> you may depend upon it, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undeniable: It would be thought as ſtrange a thing in <hi>Scotland</hi> for any Man to doubt of it, as of the Death of my Lord <hi>Dundee,</hi> or with you that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> loſt his Head. But to Put you out of all doubt, you will e'er long have my Ld. <hi>Argyle</hi>'s Regiment wity you in <hi>London,</hi> and there you may ſpeak with <hi>Glenlyon</hi> himſelf, with <hi>Drummond,</hi> and the reſt of the Actors in that diſmal Tragedy; and on my Life there is never a one of them will deny it to you; for they know that it is notoriouſly known all over <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it is an admiration to us that there ſhould be any one in <hi>England</hi> who makes the leaſt doubt of it. Nay, <hi>Glenlyon</hi> is ſo far from denying it, that he brags of it, and juſtifies the Action pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly: He ſaid in the Royal Coffee-houſe in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> that he would do it again; nay, that he would ſtab any Man in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or in <hi>England,</hi> without asking the cauſe, if the King gave him orders, and that it was every good Subject's duty ſo to go; and I am credibly informed, that <hi>Glenlyon</hi> and the reſt of them have addreſs'd themſelves to the Council for a Reward for their good Service, in deſtroying <hi>Glenco</hi> purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to their Orders.</p>
                  <p>There is enough of this mournfull Subject: If what I have ſaid ſatisfie you not, you may have what Proof, and in what manner ye pleaſe to ask it.</p>

                  <p>IN obedience to your Excellency's Order, bearing date the 12th day of this Inſtant <hi>June,</hi> we have conſidered of his Majeſty's Letters thereunto annexed, in favor of the Right Honorable <hi>Jennico</hi> Ld. Viſcount <hi>Gormanſtowne,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Ld. Viſcount <hi>Ikerin,</hi> concerning the Reverſion of the Outlawries againſt their Anceſtors; and having adviſed with the reſt of his Majeſty's Counſel at Law in this Kingdom, we humbly offer to your Excellency's Conſideration, That ſome time after his late Majeſty's happy Reſtauration we find ſeveral Applications were made for the allowing of Writs of Error to be iſſued, in order to the Reverſion of Outlawries in High Treaſon, and Attainders upon Account of the late Rebellion; which being referred to his Majeſty's then Judges in this Kingdom, there were ſeveral Debates then had before them, whether ſuch Outlawries could be reverſed, by reaſon of the Statute made in the 27th Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the Attainder of <hi>James Euſtace</hi> late Viſcount <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinglaſs,</hi> and others therein mentioned, who had been lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by due courſe of Law outlawed, and attained of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and the Statute confirms thoſe Outlawries and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which were paſt, any Error, Inſufficiency, or other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in form or Matter in them to the contrary notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and farther enacts for the time to come, that every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender thereafter, being lawfully convict of Treaſon by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict or Proceſs of Outlawry, according to the due courſe of the Common Laws or Statutes of this Realm, ſhould forfeit all his Lands of any Eſtate of Inheritance; and that every ſuch Attainder, according to the courſe of the common Laws and Statutes of this Realm, ſhould be of the ſame force as if it had been by Act of Parliament; and by reaſon alſo that ſince the making of that Statute they did not find that any
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59238:145"/>Outlawry or Attainder for Treaſon in this Kingdom had been reverſed by Writ of Error, eſpecially after the death of the Party outlawed, and his Lands granted from the Crown to others. Whereupon the ſaid Judges having then heard Counſel on both ſides, did not come to any Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or was any thing farther done upon thoſe Applications. We do therefore offer to your Excellencies Conſideration, that many of his Majeſty's Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> and in this Kingdom, have at this time in their Poſſeſſion the Lands of divers old Proprietors, who in the Year 1641. and after, were outlawed for Treaſon; which Lands have been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by Letters Patents upon the late Settlement of this Kingdom; ſome of whoſe Titles may be weakened or prejudiced, as we humbly conceive, by the Reverſal of ſuch Outlawries; and ſome parts of theſe two Lords Eſtates are now (as appears by the Petition of Captain <hi>Daniel Gahan,</hi> Sir <hi>William Petty,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Green</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency hath referred unto us,) in their poſſeſſions, who hold the ſame by Letters Patents from his Majeſty, and have thereupon humbly Petitioned your Excellency to take their Caſe into your Excellency's Conſideration. That as to ſuch Lands as theſe two Lords, or the Heirs of ſuch other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have been ſo outlawed are in poſſeſſion of, or have been reſtored unto by virtue of the late Acts of Settlement, they are not, as we conceive, diſabled, or any ways hindred by ſuch Outlawries from enjoying the ſame. Neither do we conceive that there would be any Inconvenience in reſtoring theſe two noble Lords, who do well deſerve his Majeſty's Grace and Favour, to their Blood and Honours, with a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> that they ſhould not thereby be entituled to any Lands out of their Poſſeſſion, which have been granted by Letters Patents to others, as might be done by Act of Parliament; but upon the reverſal of any Outlawries by Writs of Error, there can be no reſtriction in the Judgment, which muſt by Law be general; that they ſhall be reſtored to whatſoever they loſt by reaſon of ſuch Outlawries. But whether upon the whole Matter your Excellency will think fit to iſſue ſuch Warrants forthwith, in order to the reverſal of the ſaid Outlawries, as by his Majeſty's ſaid Letters are directed, on
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59238:146"/>behalf the ſaid Lords Viſcounts <hi>Gormanſtowne</hi> and <hi>Ikerin,</hi> or will forbear the ſame till his Majeſty's Pleaſure herein ſhall be farther known, is humbly ſubmitted to your Excellency's Conſideration.</p>
